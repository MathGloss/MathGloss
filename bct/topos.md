Let $ \mathscr{A} $ be a well - powered category with pullbacks, and write $ \Sub(A) $ for the set of subobjects of an object $ A \in \mathscr{A} $ . A **topos** is a cartesian closed category with finite limits and a subobject classifier. You have just completed the proof that $ \mathbf{Set} $ is a topos.
