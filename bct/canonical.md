In contrast, to specify an isomorphism between $ V $ and its single dual $ V^* $ , we need to make an arbitrary choice of basis, and the isomorphism really does depend on the basis that we choose. In the example on vector spaces, the word **canonical** was used. It is an informal word, meaning something like `God - given' or `defined without making arbitrary choices'.
