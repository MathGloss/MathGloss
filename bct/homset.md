Many authors take local smallness to be part of the definition of category. The class $ \mathscr{A}(A, B) $ is often called the **hom - set** from $ A $ to $ B $ , although strictly speaking, we should only call it this when $ \mathscr{A} $ is locally small. Example: $ \mathbf{Set} $ is locally small, because for any two sets $ A $ and $ B $ , the functions from $ A $ to $ B $ form a set.
