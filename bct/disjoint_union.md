There are inclusion functions $ A \stackrel{i}{\longrightarrow} A + B \leftarrowby{j} B $ such that the union of the images of $ i $ and $ j $ is all of $ A + B $ and the intersection of the images is empty. Sum is sometimes called **disjoint union** and written as $ \amalg $ . It is not to be confused with (ordinary) union $ \cup $ .
