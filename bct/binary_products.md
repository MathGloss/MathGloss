Thus, in the three examples above, $ x \wedge y = \min{x, y } , \qquad X \wedge Y = X \cap Y, \qquad x \wedge y = \gcd(x, y), $ the second example being the origin of the notation. We have been discussing products $ X \times Y $ of *two* objects, so - called **binary products**. But there is no reason to stick to two.
