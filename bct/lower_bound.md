Example: In ordered sets, the extension from binary to arbitrary products works in the obvious way: given an ordered set $ (A, \mathord{\leq}) $ , a **lower bound** for a family $ (x_i)_{i \in I} $ of elements is an element $ a \in A $ such that $ a \leq x_i $ for all $ i $ , and a **greatest lower bound** or **meet** of the family is a lower bound greater than any other, written as $ \bigwedge_{i \in I} x_i $ . These are the products in $ (A, \mathord{\leq}) $ .
