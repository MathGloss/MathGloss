(Compare Exercise X.) Let $ \mathscr{A} $ be a category and $ A \in \mathscr{A} $ . Define a **quotient object** of $ A $ to be an isomorphism class of epics out of $ A $ . That is, let $ \mathbf{Epic}(A) $ be the full subcategory of $ A/\mathscr{A} $ whose objects are the epics; then a quotient object of $ A $ is an isomorphism class of objects of $ \mathbf{Epic}(A) $ .
