It is not a genuine order, since $ \left\| A \right\| \leq \left\| B \right\| \leq \left\| A \right\| $ only implies that $ A \cong B $ , not $ A = B $ . We write $ \left\| A \right\| = \left\| B \right\| $ , and say that $ A $ and $ B $ **have the same cardinality**, if $ A \cong B $ , or equivalently if $ \left\| A \right\| \leq \left\| B \right\| \leq \left\| A \right\| $ . As long as we do not confuse equality with isomorphism, the sign $ \leq $ behaves as we might imagine.
