Here is one more shape of colimit, dual to that in Example X. Example: A diagram $ D{\colon}\linebreak[0] (\nat, \mathord{\leq}) \to \mathscr{A} $ consists of objects and maps $ X_0 \stackrel{s_1}{\longrightarrow} X_1 \stackrel{s_2}{\longrightarrow} X_2 \stackrel{s_3}{\longrightarrow} \cdots $ in $ \mathscr{A} $ . Colimits of such diagrams are traditionally called **direct limits**. Although the old terms `inverse limit' (Example X) and `direct limit' are made redundant by the general categorical terms `limit' and `colimit' respectively, it is worth being aware of them.
