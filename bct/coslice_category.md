One can check that it has the same maps too, so that $ \mathscr{A}/A \cong \comma{1_{\mathscr{A}}}{A} $ . Dually (reversing all the arrows), there is a **coslice category** $ A/\mathscr{A} \cong A {\mathbin{\Rightarrow} 1_{\mathscr{A}}} $ , whose objects are the maps out of $ A $ . Example: Let $ G{\colon}\linebreak[0] \mathscr{B} \to \mathscr{A} $ be a functor and let $ A \in \mathscr{A} $ .
