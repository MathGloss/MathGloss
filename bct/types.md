A better answer would be `your question makes no sense'. This illustrates the idea of **types**. The square root of $ 2 $ is a real number, $ \rationals $ is a field, $ S_3 $ is a group, $ \log $ is a function from $ (0, \infty) $ to $ \reals $ , and $ \frac{d}{dx} $ is an operation that takes as input one function from $ \reals $ to $ \reals $ and produces as output another such function.
