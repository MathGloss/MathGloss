Example: Let $ (A, \mathord{\leq}) $ be an ordered set. **Upper bounds** and **least upper bounds** (or **joins**) in $ A $ are defined by dualizing the definitions in Example X, and, dually, they are sums in the corresponding category. The join of a family $ (x_i)_{i \in I} $ is written as $ \bigvee_{\! i \in I} x_i $ .
