Let $ \mathscr{A} $ be a category and $ A \in \mathscr{A} $ . A **subobject** of $ A $ is an isomorphism class of monics into $ A $ . More precisely, let $ \mathbf{Monic}(A) $ be the full subcategory of $ \mathscr{A}/A $ whose objects are the monics; then a subobject of $ A $ is an isomorphism class of objects of $ \mathbf{Monic}(A) $ .
