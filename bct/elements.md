To clarify the statement, first recall that by definition, a representation of $ X $ is an object $ A \in \mathscr{A} $ together with a natural isomorphism $ \alpha{\colon}\linebreak[0] \h_A \stackrel{\textstyle{}{\longrightarrow}_\sim} X $ . Corollary X states that such pairs $ (A, \alpha) $ are in natural bijection with pairs $ (A, u) $ satisfying condition X. Pairs $ (B, x) $ with $ B \in \mathscr{A} $ and $ x \in X(B) $ are sometimes called **elements** of the presheaf $ X $ . (Indeed, the Yoneda lemma tells us that $ x $ amounts to a generalized element of $ X $ of shape $ \h_B $ .)
