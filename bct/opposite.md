Here are two ways of constructing new categories from old. {\sloppy Every category $ \mathscr{A} $ has an **opposite** or **dual** category $ \mathscr{A}^\op $ , defined by reversing the arrows. Formally, $ \ob(\mathscr{A}^\op) = \ob(\mathscr{A}) $ and $ \mathscr{A}^\op(B, A) = \mathscr{A}(A, B) $ for all objects $ A $ and $ B $ .
