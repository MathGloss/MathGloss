$ \left\| A_j \right\| \leq \biggl| \sum_{i \in I} A_i \biggr| < \left\| A \right\|. $ Hence $ \left\| A_j \right\| < \left\| A \right\| $ by X, and in particular, $ A_j \not\cong A $ . We use the word **class** informally to mean any collection of mathematical objects. All sets are classes, but some classes (such as the class of all sets) are too big to be sets.
