By definition, a category is finite if it contains only finitely many maps (in which case it also contains only finitely many objects). A **finite limit** is a limit of shape $ \mathbf{I} $ for some finite category $ \mathbf{I} $ . For instance, binary products, terminal objects, equalizers and pullbacks are all finite limits.
