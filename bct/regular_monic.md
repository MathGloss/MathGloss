Arguably, `quotient object' would be more suitable for an isomorphism class of *regular* epics, as defined in the following exercises.) A map $ m{\colon}\linebreak[0] A \to B $ is **regular monic** if there exist an object $ C $ and maps $ B \rightrightarrows C $ of which $ m $ is an equalizer. A map $ m{\colon}\linebreak[0] A \to B $ is split monic if there exists a map $ e{\colon}\linebreak[0] B \to A $ such that $ em = 1_A $ .
