Which description we use is not enormously important, but in the long run, the convention in Definition X makes life easier. An ordinary functor $ \mathscr{A} \to \mathscr{B} $ is sometimes called a **covariant functor** from $ \mathscr{A} $ to $ \mathscr{B} $ , for emphasis. Example: We can tell a lot about a space by examining the functions on it.
