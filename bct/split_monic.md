A map $ m{\colon}\linebreak[0] A \to B $ is regular monic if there exist an object $ C $ and maps $ B \rightrightarrows C $ of which $ m $ is an equalizer. A map $ m{\colon}\linebreak[0] A \to B $ is **split monic** if there exists a map $ e{\colon}\linebreak[0] B \to A $ such that $ em = 1_A $ . Dualizing the definitions in Exercise X gives definitions of regular and split epic.
