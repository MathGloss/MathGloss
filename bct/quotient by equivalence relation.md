Let $ A $ be a set and $ \sim $ an equivalence relation on $ A $ . There is a set $ A/\mathord{\sim} $ , the **quotient of $ A $ by $ \sim $ **, whose elements are the equivalence classes. For example, given a group $ G $ and a normal subgroup $ N $ , define an equivalence relation $ \sim $ on $ G $ by $ g \sim h \iff gh^{ - 1} \in N $ ; then $ G/\mathord{\sim} = G/N $ .
