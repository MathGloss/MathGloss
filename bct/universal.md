(Indeed, the Yoneda lemma tells us that $ x $ amounts to a generalized element of $ X $ of shape $ \h_B $ .) An element $ u $ satisfying condition X is sometimes called a **universal** element of $ X $ . So, Corollary X says that a representation of a presheaf $ X $ amounts to a universal element of $ X $ .
