We have defined: This composition of natural transformations is sometimes called vertical composition. There is also **horizontal composition**, which takes natural transformations $ \xymatrix@C+.5em{ \mathscr{A} \rtwocell<4>^F_G{\alpha} & \mathscr{A}' \rtwocell<4>^{F'}_{G'}{\alpha'} & \mathscr{A}'' } $ and produces a natural transformation $ \xymatrix@C+.5em{ \mathscr{A} \rtwocell<4>^{F' \circ F}_{G' \circ G} &\mathscr{A}'', } $ traditionally written as $ \alpha' * \alpha $ . The component of $ \alpha' * \alpha $ at $ A \in \mathscr{A} $ is defined to be the diagonal of the naturality square
