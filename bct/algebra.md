For example, the theory of groups has one operation of arity $ 2 $ , one of arity $ 1 $ , and one of arity $ 0 $ . An **algebra** or **model** for an algebraic theory consists of a set $ X $ together with a specified map $ X^n \to X $ for each operation of arity $ n $ , such that the equations hold everywhere. For example, an algebra for the theory of groups is exactly a group.
