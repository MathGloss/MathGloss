This can reasonably be taken as the *definition* of representation. Example: When $ A $ and $ B $ are (pre)ordered sets, a functor between the corresponding categories is exactly an **order - preserving map**, that is, a function $ f{\colon}\linebreak[0] A \to B $ such that $ a \leq a' \implies f(a) \leq f(a') $ . Exercise X asks you to verify this.
