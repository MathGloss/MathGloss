1. Let $\mathbf{I}$ be a small category.  A category $\mathscr{A}$ **has    limits of shape $\mathbf{I**$} if for every diagram $D$ of shape $\mathbf{I}$ in $\mathscr{A}$, a limit of $D$ exists.\n2. A category **has all limits** (or properly, **has small limits**) if it has limits of shape $\mathbf{I}$ for all small categories $\mathbf{I}$.
