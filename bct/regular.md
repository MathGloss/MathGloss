A map $ m{\colon}\linebreak[0] A \to B $ is split monic if there exists a map $ e{\colon}\linebreak[0] B \to A $ such that $ em = 1_A $ . Dualizing the definitions in Exercise X gives definitions of **regular** and **split epic**. The result of Exercise X can be phrased as `the class of monics is stable under pullback'.
