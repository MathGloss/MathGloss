An important step in the proof is to simply forget that the field is a field, remembering only that it is a vector space over its subfield $ {0, 1, 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1, \ldots } $ . **Free functors** are in some sense dual to forgetful functors (as we will see in the next chapter), although they are less elementary. Again, `free functor' is an informal but useful term.
