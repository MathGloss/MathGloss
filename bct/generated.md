We will need to use the fact that for any binary relation $ R $ on a set $ A $ , there is a smallest equivalence relation $ \sim $ containing $ R $ . This is called the equivalence relation **generated** by $ R $ . `Smallest' means that any equivalence relation containing $ R $ also contains $ \sim $ .
