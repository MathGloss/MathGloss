Let $\oppairi{\mathscr{A}}{\mathscr{B}}{F}{G}$ be categories and functors.  We say that $F$ is **left adjoint**    to $G$, and $G$ is **right adjoint** to $F$, and write $F \dashv G$,     if   $$          \mathscr{B}(F(A), B) \cong \mathscr{A}(A, G(B)) $$   naturally in $A \in \mathscr{A}$ and $B \in \mathscr{B}$.  The meaning of `naturally' is defined below.  An **adjunction** between $F$ and $G$ is a choice of natural isomorphism~.
