Let $ \mathscr{A} $ and $ \mathscr{B} $ be categories. A **contravariant functor** from $ \mathscr{A} $ to $ \mathscr{B} $ is a functor $ \mathscr{A}^\op \to \mathscr{B} $ . To avoid confusion, we write `a contravariant functor from $ \mathscr{A} $ to $ \mathscr{B} $ ' rather than `a contravariant functor $ \mathscr{A} \to \mathscr{B} $ '.
