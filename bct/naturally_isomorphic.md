Proof: Exercise X. Of course, we say that functors $ F $ and $ G $ are **naturally isomorphic** if there exists a natural isomorphism from $ F $ to $ G $ . Since natural isomorphism is just isomorphism in a particular category (namely, $ \ftrcat{\mathscr{A}}{\mathscr{B}} $ ), we already have notation for this: $ F \cong G $ .Given functors $ \parpair{\mathscr{A}}{\mathscr{B}}{F}{G} $ , we say that $ F(A) \cong G(A) \text{ naturally in } A $ if $ F $ and $ G $ are naturally isomorphic.
