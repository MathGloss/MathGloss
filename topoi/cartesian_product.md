One way to cope with this point would be to modify the definition of function in the following way. Firstly for sets $ A $ and $ B $ we define the _product set_ or _Cartesian product_ of $ A $ and $ B $ to be the set of all ordered pairs whose first elements are in $ A $ and second elements in $ B $ . This is Figure 2.2: denoted $ Atimes B $
