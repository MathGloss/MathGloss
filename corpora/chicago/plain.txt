If $ (X, leq) $ is a lattice, we call the supremum of $ x $ and $ y $ the join of $ x $ and $ y $ and denote it $ xlor y $ .
Similarly, we call the infimum of $ x $ and $ y $ their meet and denote it $ xland y $ .
These are in fact binary operations on $ X $ .

An outer measure on $ X $ is a function $ mu: mathcal P(X) to 0,infty $ such that - $ mu(emptyset) = 0 $ - if $ A, B subset X $ with $ Asubset B $ , then $ mu(A) leqmu(B) $ - for arbitrary subsets $ B_i subset X $ for $ i in mathbb N $ , we have $ muleft(bigcuplimits_{iinmathbb N} B_i right)leq sumlimits_{iinmathbb N}mu(B_i) $ .
Let $ V $ be a vector space.
The set $ W subseteq V $ spans $ V $ if for all $ v in V $ , there exists $ n in mathbb N $ , a collection $ {alpha_i}_{i=1}^n subset mathbb R $ , and a collection $ {v_i}_{i=1}^n subset W $ such that $ v = sum_{i=1}^n alpha_i v_i $ .
Let $ X $ be a set.
The symmetric group $ S_X $ is the set of all bijections from $ X $ to itself.
When $ X $ is finite with cardinal number $ n $ , it is denoted $ S_n $ and consists of the set of permutations on $ n $ letters.
The action of a group $ G $ on the set $ X $ is transitive if for every pair $ x,y in X $ , there exists $ gin G $ such that $ gcdot x=y $ .
Let $ A $ be a Banach algebra with norm $ |cdot | $ .
Given a sequence $ {a_i}_{iin mathbb N} $ of elements of $ A $ , we say that the series $ sum_{i=1}^infty a_i $ is absolutely convergent if $ sum_{i=1}^infty |a_i| <infty, $ i.e. if the series $ {|a_i|}_{iinmathbb N} $ is convergent as real numbers.
This means that the partial sums $ sum_{i=1}^n a_i $ form a Cauchy sequence in $ A $ , which is complete, and therefore must have a limit in $ A $ .
We denote this limit by the infinite sum.
Let $ A $ be an elementary abelian p - group and let $ mathbf ain(a_1,dots,a_r)in A^r $ .
Let $ f_mathbf a:(mathbb Z/pmathbb Z)to A $ be the unique homomorphism satisfying $ f_mathbf a(1,0,dot,0) = a_1, dots, f_mathbf a(0,dots, 1) = a_r $ .
If the function $ f_mathbf a $ is injective, then the $ a_i $ are linearly independent .
Let $ R $ be an integral domain and let $ M $ be an $ R $ - module.

Let $ (X,rho) $ be a metric space.

An at - most - countable collection $ {A_i}_{iin I} $ whose elements are called atomic formulae or propositional variables together with some subset of the logical connectors $ (land, lor, rightarrow, leftrightarrow, neg) $ and $ {top, bot} $ is called a language for propositional logic .
Name this whole agglomeration $ L $ .
Then $ text{Form}(L) $ is the smallest set containing $ {A_i}_{iin I} $ , $ top $ , and $ bot $ that is closed under the remaining logical operators, which at their most basic take two (one in the case of $ neg $ ) atomic variables and spit out a new formula.
We know that this set is nonempty because there exists a set $ D $ consisting of all finite strings with characters drawn from $ {A_i}_{iin I} $ , $ top $ , $ bot $ , and $ {land,lor, rightarrow, leftrightarrow, neg} $ .
Consider $ bigcap _{Sin F}S $ where $ F $ is a collection of sets that are subsets of $ D $ satisfying the closure property.
This is the smallest such set, but it does not tell us what the elements look like.
Consider a map $ LC: mathcal P(D) to mathcal P(D) $ given by $ LC(S)= Scup{(B)rightarrow (C), (B)leftrightarrow (C), (B)land (C), (B)lor (C), neg(B) mid B,Cin S} $ .
Let $ H = bigcup_{iin mathbb N} LC^i ({A_j}_{jin I} cup {bot,top}) $ .
Then $ H = text{Form}(L) $ : Let $ S $ be some candidate set for $ text{Form}(L) $ .
It suffices to show that $ Hsubseteq S $ .
To show this it suffices to show that $ LC^i ({A_j}_{jin I} cup {bot,top}) subseteq S $ for all $ i $ .
The base case $ i=0 $ follows from the definition we are looking to satisfy and the hypothesis that $ S $ satisfies it.
The inductive step follows immediately from the definition and its closure property.

The $ m $ - fold symmetric product of $ V $ is the quotient vector space of the $ m $ - fold tensor product $ V^{otimes m} $ by the subspace generated by the tensors $ v_1otimescdotsotimes v_m - v_{sigma(1)}otimes cdotsotimes v_{sigma(m)} $ for all $ v_i in V $ and all $ sigma in S_m $ (the set of permutations of $ {1,dots,m} $ ).
It is denoted $ text{Sym}^m(V) $ .
A linear transformation $ T:Vto V $ from a normed linear space $ V $ to itself is compact if the closure of the image of the closed unit ball $ B = {v in V mid ||v|| leq 1} $ is compact in the usual sense.
The quaternion algebra $ mathbb H $ is the four - dimensional associative algebra over $ mathbb R $ spanned by the elements $ 1,mathbf i,mathbf j,mathbf k $ where $ 1 $ is the identity element and the relations (i) $ mathbf i^2 = mathbf j^2 = mathbf k^2 = - 1 $ ; (ii) $ mathbf{ij} = mathbf k $ ; (iii) $ mathbf{ji} = - mathbf k $ ; (iv) $ mathbf{jk} = mathbf i $ ; (v) $ mathbf{kj} = - mathbf i $ ; (vi) $ mathbf{ki} = mathbf j $ ; (vii) $ mathbf{ik} = - mathbf j $ .
This can be considered as a sub(?) of the set of $ 2times 2 $ complex matrices $ M_2(mathbb C) $ by setting $ mathbf i = }, quad mathbf j = },quad mathbf k = } $ .
Then $ mathbb H $ is the space of real linear combinations of $ I_2 $ , $ mathbb i $ , $ mathbb j $ , and $ mathbb k $ .
Let $ X $ be a âˆ† - complex.

A field or algebra of subsets of a set $ X $ is a pair $ (X, mathcal F) $ consisting of the set $ X $ and a collection $ mathcal F $ of subset of $ X $ such that (i) $ mathcal F $ is closed under complementation: $ Xsetminus F in mathcal F $ for all $ F in mathcal F $ ; (ii) $ mathcal F $ contains the empty set.
Equivalently, if (1) holds, $ mathcal F $ contains $ X $ ; (iii) Any of the following equivalent (by induction and De Morgan's laws) conditions hold: - $ mathcal F $ is closed under binary union: $ Fcup G in mathcal F $ for all $ F, G in mathcal F $ ; - $ mathcal F $ is closed under binary intersection: $ Fcap G in mathcal F $ for all $ F,G in mathcal F $ ; - $ mathcal F $ is closed under finite unions; - $ mathcal F $ is closed under finite intersections.

Let $ G $ be a matrix Lie group.
The identity component $ G_0 $ of $ G $ is the set of $ Ain G $ for which there exists a continuous path $ gamma:0,1to G $ such that $ gamma(0) = I $ and $ gamma(1) = A $ .
Because connectedness and path - connectedness are equivalent in this case, $ G_0 $ amounts to the connected component of $ G $ that contains the identity matrix $ I $ .
Let $ mathfrak g $ be a Lie algebra and let $ (V,rho_V) $ and $ (W,rho_W) $ be representations of $ mathfrak g $ .
Then the tensor product of these representations is the pair $ (Votimes W, rho_{Votimes W}) $ where $ rho_{Votimes W}(x) = rho_V(x) otimes text{Id} + text{Id}otimes rho_W(x) $ for all $ x in mathfrak g $ .
The projectivization of a vector space $ (V,F) $ is the quotient of $ V $ by the action of the multiplicative group of the base field $ F $ by scalar multiplication.
Let $ Lambda={mu = (mu_1,dots, mu_n)inmathbb Z^n mid mu_1geq cdotsgeq mu_n geq 0} subseteq mathbb Z^n_{geq 0} $ .
For each $ mu in Lambda $ , define $ nabla_mu in mathbb Zx_1,dots, x_n^text{sign} $ to be the antisymmetric polynomial under the sign representation of the symmetric group given by $ nabla_mu = sum_{sin S_n} text{sign}(s) x^{s(mu)} = detleft|} right| $ .
The second equality follows from the Leibniz formula for determinants.
Set $ rho in Lambda $ to $ rho = (n - 1,n - 2,dots, 1, 0) $ .
Up to sign, $ nabla_rho $ is the Vandermonde determinant.
Because $ mathbb Zx_1,dots, x_n^text{sign} $ is a rank - one free module over $ mathbb Zx_1,dots, x_n^{S_n} $ with generator $ Delta_n $ , it follows that $ nabla_rho $ is also a generator of this module.
Thus for every $ muin Lambda $ there exists a unique polynomial $ s_muinmathbb Zx_1,dots, x_n^{S_n} $ called the Schur polynomial of $ mu $ such that $ nabla_{mu + rho} = s_mu cdotnabla_rho $ .
Explicitly, $ s_mu = nabla_{mu + rho}/nabla_rho $ .

The fiber is the inverse image under $ f $ of the singleton $ {y} $ .
Let $ mathbb k $ be a field and consider the algebra of polynomials in $ n $ variables $ P_n =bigopluslimits_{dgeq 0} P_n^d $ .
Given a representation of a group $ G $ in $ mathbb k^n $ , we get an action of $ G $ on $ P_n $ by the induced action of group on maps: for $ fin P_n $ , $ g:fmapsto g^*f $ .
Then each homogeneous subspace $ P_n^d $ of $ P_n $ is a $ G $ - invariant subspace.
Moreover, the algebra of invariant polynomials, written $ P_n^G $ , is a graded subalgebra of $ P_n $ .
An element $ x $ of an integral domain is prime if the ideal generated by $ x $ is a prime ideal.

See covering space.
Let $ X $ be a âˆ† - complex and let $ Delta_n(X) $ be the free abelian group on the open n - simplices of $ X $ .
Elements of $ Delta_n(X) $ are called $ n $ - chains and can be written as formal finite sums $ sum_alpha n_alpha e_alpha^n $ for $ n_alpha in mathbb Z $ .

Formally, $ text{Hol}(G) = Grtimes text{Aut}(G) $ where the homomorphism $ rho: text{Aut}(G)to text{Aut}(G) $ associated to the semidirect product is the identity function.
Thus the product of elements of $ text{Hol}(G) $ is as follows: $ (g,alpha)(h,beta) = (galpha(h),alphabeta) $ .

Note that in general, $ Delta $ contains one factor of $ (x_i - x_j) $ for all $ i < j $ .
Because $ sigma $ is a bijection on the indices, $ sigma(Delta) $ contains either a factor of $ (x_i - x_j) $ or a factor of $ (x_j - x_i) $ but not both.
If the latter, we may write it as $ ( - 1)(x_i - x_j)) $ .

Proof that it is a character First, we show that $ psi_u $ is a group homomorphism: $ psi_u(x+y) = psi(u(x+y)) = psi(ux+uy) = psi(ux)psi(uy) = psi_u(x)psi_u(y) $ from the fact that $ psi $ is itself a group homomorphism.
Finally, $ psi_u $ is continuous because the composition of continuous functions is continuous and $ psi $ is the composition of $ psi $ , which is itself continuous by virtue of it being a multiplicative character, and because $ mathbb Q_p $ is a topological field, the map given by "multiplication by $ u $ " is also continuous.

Let $ A $ be an algebra over the field $ mathbb k $ and let $ ain A $ .
Then the subalgebra $ A_a $ generated by $ a $ is the image of the algebra homomorphism from the polynomials $ mathbb kt $ to $ A $ given by $ fmapsto f(a) $ .
The kernel of this map is an ideal of $ mathbb kt $ consisting of polynomials such that $ f(a) = 0 $ .
Denote this ideal by $ I_a $ and note that it is a principal ideal because $ mathbb kx $ is a principal ideal domain.
The element $ ain A $ is algebraic if there exists a nonzero polynomial $ finmathbb kt $ such that $ f(a)=0 $ , i.e. if $ I_aneq 0 $ .
Then because $ I_a $ must be principal, there exists a unique monic polynomial $ p_a $ that generates $ I_a $ and this is called the minimal polynomial of $ a $ .

The composition $ d_nd_{n+1} $ is zero because the composition of consecutive boundary homomorphisms is 0.

The group algebra of a group $ G $ is the group ring of $ G $ over $ mathbb C $ is denoted $ mathbb CG $ and is the set of maps $ f:Gto mathbb C $ with finite support.
This forms a module over a ring over $ mathbb C $ , and because $ mathbb C $ is a field, it is a vector space over $ mathbb C $ .
The module scalar product of $ alphain mathbb C $ and $ fin mathbb CG $ is the map $ xmapsto alphacdot f(x) $ .
