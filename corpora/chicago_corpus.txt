The Haar integral is this $\mathbb C$-linear function $\int:C_c(X) \to \mathbb C$  such that 1. for all $f\in C_c(X)$, if $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x\in X$ then $\int_X f \geq 0$. Moreover, $\int_X f= 0$ implies that $f=0$.  (when $f(x)$ is real) 2. For any compact $K\subset X$, there exists some $c_K\geq 0$ such that for all continuous functions with support in $K$, $\left\vert \int_X f\right\vert  \leq c_K\cdot \max\limits_{x\in K} \vert f(x)\vert $.  If we want the integral to be invariant with respect to the action of a group, we choose the measure to be the Haar measure.  Also keep in mind that this is in fact a special case of the Lebesgue integral!

Let $G$ be a group acting on the set $X$. A point $x\in X$ is a fixed point for or an invariant of the $G$-action if $g\cdot x=x$ for every $g\in G$. The set of these points is denoted $X^G$.
A representation of a topological group $G$ (written $\rho:G\to GL(V)$ for $GL(V)$  the general linear group of some vector space $V$) is called continuous if it is of finite dimension of dimension and if $\rho$ is continuous in the usual sense as a function between topological spaces.
Let $\mathfrak g$ be a Lie algebra and let $(V,\rho_V)$ and $(W,\rho_W)$ be representations of $\mathfrak g$. Then the tensor product of these representations is the pair $(V\otimes W, \rho_{V\otimes W})$ where $$\rho_{V\otimes W}(x) = \rho_V(x) \otimes \text{Id} + \text{Id}\otimes \rho_W(x)$$ for all $x \in \mathfrak g$.

In a general topological space, (i.e. in some non-Hausdorff spaces) the limit of a sequence need not be unique!

It is defined for a the matrix $A$ of $T$ as $$\text{det}(A) = \text{det}(A_1,\dots,A_n)$$ where the $A_i$ are the columns of $A$.

Let $\Lambda=\{\mu = (\mu_1,\dots, \mu_n)\in\mathbb Z^n \mid \mu_1\geq \cdots\geq \mu_n \geq 0\} \subseteq \mathbb Z^n_{\geq 0}$. For each $\mu \in \Lambda$, define $\nabla_\mu \in \mathbb Z[x_1,\dots, x_n]^\text{sign}$ to be the antisymmetric polynomial under the sign representation of the symmetric group given by $$\nabla_\mu = \sum_{s\in S_n} \text{sign}(s) x^{s(\mu)} = \det\left\vert \begin{matrix}x_1^{\mu_1}  & x_1^{\mu_2} & \cdots & x_1^{\mu_n} \\ x_2^{\mu_1} & x_2^{\mu_2} & \cdots & x_2^{\mu_n} \\ \vdots &\vdots & \ddots &\vdots \\ x_n^{\mu_1} & x_n^{\mu_2}&\cdots & x_n^{\mu_n}\end{matrix} \right\vert .$$ The second equality follows from the Leibniz formula for determinants.   Set $\rho \in \Lambda$ to $\rho = (n-1,n-2,\dots, 1, 0)$. Up to sign, $\nabla_\rho$ is the Vandermonde determinant.   Because $\mathbb Z[x_1,\dots, x_n]^\text{sign}$ is a rank-one free module over $\mathbb Z[x_1,\dots, x_n]^{S_n}$ with generator $\Delta_n$, it follows that $\nabla_\rho$ is also a generator of this module. Thus for every $\mu\in \Lambda$ there exists a unique polynomial $s_\mu\in\mathbb Z[x_1,\dots, x_n]^{S_n}$ called the Schur polynomial of $\mu$ such that $\nabla_{\mu + \rho} = s_\mu \cdot\nabla_\rho$.   Explicitly, $s_\mu = \nabla_{\mu + \rho}/\nabla_\rho$.
Let $(X,\Sigma)$ and $(Y, T)$ be measurable spaces. A function $f:X\to Y$ is measurable if the preimage under $f$ of every set in $T$ is in $\Sigma$.

Let $A$ be a Banach algebra with norm $\vert \cdot \vert$. Given a sequence $\{a_i\}_{i\in \mathbb N}$ of elements of $A$, the series $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i$$ is absolutely convergent if there exists $L \in\mathbb R$ such that  $$\sum_{i=1}^\infty \vert a_i\vert =L.$$  This means that the partial sums $$\sum_{i=1}^n a_i$$ form a Cauchy sequence in $A$, and since $A$ is complete by definition, the sequence must have a limit in $A$. We denote this limit by the infinite sum.
Let $U \subset \mathbb R^n$ be open. The set $U$ is the graph of a some function if for all $x \in U$, there exists unique $y \in \mathbb R^m$ such that $(x,y) \in A$.  Alternatively, let $f:A\to B$ be a set function. The set $$\Gamma = \{(a,b) \in A\times B \mid b=f(a)\}$$ is the graph of $f$.

A topological space $X$ is weak Hausdorff if for every map $g:K\to X$ from a compact Hausdorff space $K$ is closed in $X$.   Note that $g(K)$ is itself Hausdorff, ( todo: why?) so $g(K)$ is a compact subspace of $X$.

A subset $H\subset G$ of the group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if it is itself a group under the operation inherited from $G$.  The subgroup axioms are - closure under $*$; - the identity element of $G$ is in $H$; - for every $h\in H$, the inverse element $h^{-1}$ is also in $H$.
A Banach-Mazur game $MB(X,Y, \mathcal W)$ is a topological game played as follows:  Let $X$ be a topological space, $Y$ a fixed subset of $X$, and $\mathcal W$ a family of subsets of $X$ such that 1. each element of $\mathcal W$ has nonempty interior. 2. every nonempty subset of $X$ contains an element of $\mathcal W$.   Players 1 and 2 take turns picking elements of $\mathcal W$ in a sequence $W_1\supset W_2\supset\cdots$. Player 1 wins if and only if $$ Y\cap \left(\bigcap_{n<\omega} W_n\right)$$ is nonempty. If Player 1 loses, Player 2 wins.
Let $X$ be a metric space. Two metrics $\rho_1$, $\rho_2$ are equivalent if there exists $c>0$ such that $$\frac{1}{c}\rho_1(x,y) \leq \rho_2(x,y) \leq c\rho_1(x,y).$$
Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $X$. The orbit of some $x \in X$  is the set of elements of $X$ to which $x$ can be moved by the elements of $G$. It is denoted $$G\cdot x = \{g\cdot x \mid g \in G\}.$$  The set of orbits of points of $X$ creates a partition of $X$ with associated equivalence relation given by $x\sim y$ if and only if there exists $g \in G$ with $g\cdot x =y$, and the orbits are equivalence classes.  Equivalently, an orbit of $x$ is the subset of $X$ containing $x$ on which the action of $G$ is transitive transitive.
A topological field is a field $F$ that is a topological ring and also whose inverse maps $F\times F^\times\to F$ for both binary operations are also continuous.
A metric space is a set $X$ together with a function $\rho: X\times X \to \mathbb R$ such that for all $x,y,z \in X$, the following properties are satisfied: 1. $\rho(x,y) = 0$ if and only if $x=y$. 2. $\rho(x,y) = \rho(y,x)$. 3. $\rho(x,z) \leq \rho(x,y) + \rho(y,z)$.   Property 3 is called the triangle inequalityand the function $\rho$ is called a metric. The metric generates a topology on $X$ where the open sets $G$ are those for which there exists $\varepsilon > 0$  for all $x \in G$ such that $\{y\in X\mid \rho(x,y) < \varepsilon\}\subset G$.
Let $1\leq p < \infty$ and let $(X,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a measure space. Let $F$ be the set of functions $f: X\to \mathbb R$ such that $$\vert \vert f\vert \vert _p = \left(\int_X\vert f\vert ^p\text d\mu\right)^{1/p}\ < \infty$$ where $\vert \vert f\vert \vert _p$ is the p-norm. Equivalently, $F$ is the set of functions such that the $p$th power of their absolute value is integrable. Let $N = \{f \in F \mid f = 0 \text{almost everywhere}\}$. Because the integral of a positive function is zero if and only if it is zero almost everywhere, we have that $N$ is the kernel of the p-norm. The normed linear space given by the quotient vector space of $F$ by $N$ is $L_p(X,\mu)$.  For $p = \infty$, consider the set $G$ of functions $f:X \to \mathbb R$  for which there exists $c \in\mathbb R$ such that $\mu(\{\vert f\vert  > c\}) = 0$ and take the quotient vector space of this set by the equivalence relation $\sim$ on $G$ given by $f\sim g$ if $f(x) = g(x)$ almost everywhere on $X$.  This space with the essential supremum of $f$ as the norm is $L_\infty(X,\mu)$.

Let $R$ be a ring and let $M$ be an $R$-module. Then $M$ is Noetherian (or satisfies the ascending chain condition on submodules) if there are no infinite increasing chains of submodules. That is, if whenever $M_1\subseteq M_2\subseteq M_3\subseteq \cdots$ is an increasing chain of submodules of $M$, then there is a positive integer $m$ such that for all $k\geq m$, $M_k=M_m$.
Let $(X,\Sigma)$ be a measurable space with $\mu$ a signed measure. The total variation of $\mu$ is the function $\tau$ given by $$\tau(A) = \pi(A) + \nu(A)$$ where $\pi$ is the positive variation of $\mu$ and $\nu$ is the negative variation of $\mu$.
Let $X$ be a metric space with $A \subset X$. Let $\mu$ be the Lebesgue measure. A collection $\mathcal V$ of sets covering $A$ is a Vitali covering if for each $x \in A$ and $\varepsilon > 0$, there exists $U \in \mathcal V$ such that $x \in U$, and the diameter of $U$ is nonzero and less than $\varepsilon$.
A subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is characteristic in $G$ if every automorphism of $G$ leaves $H$ invariant.
If there are $a$ ways of doing one thing and $b$ ways of doing another thing, then there are $ab$ ways of doing both things.  This can be extended inductively.  Set theoretically, this is the definition of the product of cardinal numbers: $$\vert S_1\vert \cdot\vert S_2\vert \cdots\vert S_n\vert  = \vert S_1\times S_2\times\cdots S_n\vert $$ where $\vert \cdot\vert $ is the cardinal number of the sets $S_i$ and $\times$ is the Cartesian product of sets. The sets need not be finite nor does the number of sets.
Let $(V,\rho)$ be a representation of the group $G$. The $n$th symmetric power of $V_1$ and $V_2$ is a representation of $G$ over the symmetric power of vector spaces $\text{Sym}^n(V)$ under the linear transformation $\rho:G\to \text{Sym}^n(V)$ such that $$\rho(g)(v_1\odot v_2\odot \cdots \odot v_n) = (\rho(g)v_1\odot \rho(g)v_2\odot\cdots\odot\rho(g)v_n).$$

Let $F$ be a field of characteristic $p$. Then the map $x\mapsto x^p$ is called the Frobenius endomorphism.
The pair $(U,\phi)$ as in the definition of orientable defines an orientation on an embedded m-dimensional manifold with boundary $M$.  Two pairs $(U,\phi)$ and $(V,\psi)$ determine the same orientation if for every local parametrization $f:W\to M$ where $W \subset H^m$ is open in $H^m$, there exists a positive function $g:W\to\mathbb R$ such that $f^*(\phi) = gf^*\phi$.  An orientation on $M$ is an equivalence class if pairs that determine the same orientation on $M$.
Let $R$ be a ring, $L$ an $R$-module, and $\{\ell_i\}_{i\in I}$ a subset of $L$. The submodule generated by the $\ell_i$ is the set $$\left\{\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\ell_i\mid a_i\in R, \text{ all but finitely many } a_i=0\right\}.$$ Equivalently, it is the smallest submodule of $L$ containing the $\ell_i$.

The complex numbers are given by ordered pairs of real numbers: $$\mathbb C = \{(a,b)\mid a,b\in \mathbb R\}$$ and endowed with two binary operations: multiplication and addition.   Addition is defined pairwise, while multiplication is defined as $$(a,b)*(c,d) = (ac-bd,bc+ad)$$ for all $(a,b),(c,d) \in \mathbb C$.   We often write $a+bi$ for $(a,b)$ where $i^2=-1$.

Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $x$ a variable. Then $R[x]$ is the polynomial ring of polynomials in $x$ with coefficients in $R$.  We can also define the polynomial ring in multiple variables. Let $X = \{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ be a finite collection of variables. Then $R[X] = R[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ is defined as follows:  To each function $I:X\to \mathbb N$, associate a monomial $$x^I = x_1^{I(x_1)}+\cdots + x_n^{I(x_n)}.$$ Then $$R[X]= \left\{ \sum_{I:X\to \mathbb N} a_IX^I \mid a_I\in R, a_I = 0 \text{ for all but finitely many } I \right\}.$$ Multiplication and addition are defined exactly how you would think.
A ring ideal is proper if it is a proper subset of its parent ring.
A basis for a topology $\tau$ on a set $X$ is a collection $\mathcal B$ of subsets of $X$ such that  1. All points are contained in at least one element of $\mathcal B$, and 2. If $x\in B'\cap B''$ then there exists at least one $B\in \mathcal B$ such that $x\in B \subset B'\cap B''$.
Let $X$ be a topological space. A set $A\subset X$ is nowhere dense in $X$ if for every nonempty open subset $G\subset X$, there exists a nonempty open subset $H\subset G$ such that $A\cap H=\emptyset$.  Equivalently, a set $A\subset X$ id nowhere dense in $X$ if its closure has empty interior.
Let $f:A\to \mathbb C$ be a function holomorphic on the annulus $A$. Then $f(z)$ can be written as the Laurent series $$f(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n (z-c)^n$$ for $a_n,c\in \mathbb C$ and $a_n$ given by $$a_n = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \int_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{(z-c)^{n+1}}\text dz$$ for $\gamma$ a positively-oriented piecewise continuously differentiable loop in $A$.

Let $G$ be a group and let $g\in G$. Define a homomorphism $\varphi_g: G\to G$ by $\varphi_g(x) = gxg^{-1}$ for all $x\in G$. These $\varphi_g$ are in fact automorphisms and moreover $\varphi_g\circ\varphi_h = \varphi_{gh}$. The $\varphi_g$ are called inner automorphisms of $G$.

A point $x$ is an isolated point of a subset $S$ of a topological space $X$ if it is an element of $S$ but there exists a neighborhood of $x$ containing no other points of $S$.
A bounded function $f:Q\to\mathbb R$ defined on the rectangle $Q$ in $\mathbb R^n$ is integrable if the lower integral of $f$ is equal to the upper integral of $f$. The integral of $f$ over $Q$ is defined to be $$\int_Q f = \underline{\int_Q} f = \overline{\int_Q} f.$$  Alternatively, let $f: S\to \mathbb R$ be a bounded function from the bounded set $S$ to $\mathbb R$, and let $f_S$ be the extension of $S$ in the usual sense to $\mathbb R$. Choose $Q$ a rectangle containing $S$. The integral of this function over $S$ is $$\int_S f = \int_Q f_S,$$ if it exists.
Let $\mathfrak g$ be a Lie algebra. Then the adjoint map $\text{ad}:\mathfrak g \to \mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak g)$ is given by $$\text{ad}_X(Y) = [X,Y].$$ Because the adjoint map is a Lie algebra homomorphism, it is a representation of $\mathfrak g$, and therefore we may refer to $\text{ad}$ as the adjoint representation of $\mathfrak g$.
Let $V$ be a module over the ring $R$. A subset $W \subset V$ is linearly independent if for $v_i \in W$ and $\alpha_i \in R$, $$\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i v_i=0$$ only when $\alpha_i = 0$ for all $i$.

Let $V$ be a vector space. The $m$-fold symmetric product of $V$ is the quotient vector space of the $m$-fold tensor product $V^{\otimes m}$ by the subspace generated by the tensors $$v_1\otimes\cdots\otimes v_m - v_{\sigma(1)}\otimes \cdots\otimes v_{\sigma(m)}$$ for all $v_i \in V$ and all $\sigma \in S_m$ (the set of permutations of $\{1,\dots,m\}$). It is denoted $\text{Sym}^m(V)$.
An $n\times n$ real matrix $A$ is orthogonal if its column vectors (equivalently, its row vectors) are orthonormal. That is, the product of $A$ with its transpose $A^T$ is equal to the identity matrix $I_n$: $$AA^T = A^TA = I_n$$ Equivalently, the transpose of an orthogonal matrix $A$ is equal to its inverse: $A^T = A^{-1}$.
If $\sigma \in S_n$ is an element of the symmetric group on $n$ letters, then it is the product of disjoint cycles of length $n_1\leq\cdots\leq n_r$ (including the $1$-cycles!) and moreover the sum of the $n_i$ is equal to $n$. The partition of $n$ given by the $n_i$ is called the cycle type of $\sigma$.
An $m\times n$ (real or complex) matrix $A$ is a collection of $mn$ entries $(a_{ij})$ which are either real or complex numbers arranged in $m$ rows and $n$ columns as follows: $$\begin{bmatrix}a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots&\vdots &\ddots &\vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} &\cdots & a_{mn}\end{bmatrix}$$ Two matrices of the same size may be added together entrywise.
A field is a set $F$ together with two binary operations addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\cdot$) such that - Addition and multiplication are both associative; - Addition and multiplication are both commutative; - There exist two distinct elements $0\neq 1$ in $F$ such that $0$ is an additive identity and $1$ is a multiplicative identity; - Every element of $F$ has an additive inverse; - Every nonzero element of $F$ has a multiplicative inverse; - Multiplication distributes over addition as follows: $a\cdot (b+c) = (a\cdot b) + (a\cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c\in F$.   Equivalently, a field is a commutative division ring.
A field extension $E/F$ is Galois if it is algebraic, normal, and separable. The group of automorphisms of $E$ that fix $F$, denoted $\text{Gal}(E/F)$, is called the Galois group of $E$ over $F$.   Equivalently, $E$ is Galois over $F$ if the order of the automorphism group $\text{Aut}(E/F)$ is equal to the degree of $E$ over $F$.

To define the Lebesgue integral for a general real-valued function, we must first define it for nonnegative functions.  Let $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ be a measure space and let $f$ be a nonnegative, measurable, extended-real-valued function on $X$ (that is, $f(x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in X$, and it may be the case that $f(x) = +\infty$). Define $$\int_X fd\mu = \sup\left\{\int_X sd\mu \mid 0\leq s\leq f, s \text{ simple}\right\}$$ where the supremum is taken over the Lebesgue integrals of nonnegative simple functions $s$ less than $f$.  Now let $f$ be a measurable extended-real-valued function on $X$. Then $f$ may be written as $f = f^+ - f^-$ where $$f^+(x) =\begin{cases}f(x) & f(x)>0 \\0 &\text{otherwise} \end{cases} \quad\text{and}\quad f^-(x) = \begin{cases}-f(x) & f(x)<0 \\ 0 &\text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$ so that $f^+$ and $f^-$ are both nonnegative and measurable. Note that $\vert f\vert  = f^+ + f^-$. The Lebesgue integral of the measurable function $f$ exists if at least one of $\int f^+d\mu$ and $\int f^- d\mu$ is finite. In this case, define $$\int f d\mu = \int f^+d\mu - \int f^-d\mu.$$ If $\int\vert f\vert d\mu < \infty$, then $f$ is Lebesgue integrable.
