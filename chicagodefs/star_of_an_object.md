Let $\mathcal C$ be a [small](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/small_category) [groupoid](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/groupoid) and let $x$ be an object of $\mathcal C$. The **star** of $x$, denoted $\text{St}(x)$, is the set of objects of the [category of objects under](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/category_of_objects_under_x) $x$. That is, it is the set of morphisms with source $x$. 

The [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) $\mathcal C(x,x)$ of [automorphisms](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/automorphism) of $x$ is written $\pi(\mathcal C,x)$.
