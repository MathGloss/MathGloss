An (geometric) **$n$-simplex** is the smallest [convex set](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/convex_set) in $\mathbb R^m$ containing $n+1$ points $v_0,\dots, v_n$ that do not lie in a [hyperplane](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/hyperplane) of [dimension](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/dimension_of_vector_space) less than $n$. That is, that are [geometrically independent](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/geometrically_independent).

The **standard $n$-simplex** is the set $$\Delta^n = \{(t_0,\dots, t_n)\in\mathbb R^{n+1} \mid \sum_i t_i =1 \text{ and } t_i \geq 0 \forall i\}.$$

The order of the vertices $v_i$ is part of the data of an $n$-simplex. Writing an $n$-simplex as $[v_0,\dots, v_n]$ determines orientation of the edges $[v_i, v_j]$ by their order.
