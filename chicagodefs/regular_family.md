---A collection $\mathcal V$ of [measurable](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measurable) subsets of $\mathbb R^n$ is a **regular family** if there exists $C > 0$ such that the [diameter](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/diameter_of_a_set) of each $V \in \mathcal V$ satisfies the following inequality: $$\text{diam}(V)^n \leq C\mu(V).$$
