Let $G$ be a finitely [generated](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/generating_set_of_a_group) [abelian](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/abelian) [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group). By the  [Fundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Fundamental_Theorem_of_Finitely_Generated_Abelian_Groups), $G$ may be uniquely written as a [direct sum](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/direct_sum_of_groups) of [cyclic groups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/cyclic_group). The **rank** of $G$ is the number of $\mathbb Z$ summands in this expression.
