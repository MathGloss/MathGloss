A **topological ring** is a [ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring) $R$ together with a [topology](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) on the [underlying set](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/forgetful_functor) where the addition map $+:R\times R\to R$ (given by $+(a,b) = a+b$ for all $a,b\in R$) and the multiplication map $\cdot:R\times R\to R$ (given by $\cdot(a,b)= ab$ for all $a,b\in R$) are both [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous).
