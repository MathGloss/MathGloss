Let $G$ be a [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/category). The **category of canonical orbits** of $G$, denoted $\mathcal O(G)$, is the [category](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/action_of_a_group_on_quotient_by_subgroup) with objects the [G-sets](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/subgroup) $G/H$ for all [subgroups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/equivariant_map) $H$ of $G$ and morphisms the [G-maps](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/isomorphism_of_categories) that exist between the objects.

$\mathcal O(G)$ is [isomorphic](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/category) to the [category](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/#########subgroups) $\mathcal G$ whose objects are the [subgroups](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/conjugacy_classes) of $G$ and whose morphisms are the distinct sub[conjugacy](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/G-equivariant_homomorphisms_between_quotient_G-sets) relations $\gamma^{-1}H\gamma \subset K$ for $\gamma \in G$.
