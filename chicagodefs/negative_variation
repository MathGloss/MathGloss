---Let $(X,\Sigma)$ be a [measurable space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measurable) with $\mu$ a [signed measure](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/signed_measure). The **negative variation** of $\mu$ is the function $\nu$ given by $$\nu(A) = \pi(A)-\mu(A)$$ where $\pi$ is the [positive variation](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/positive_variation) of $\mu$.
