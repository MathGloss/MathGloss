Let $X$ be a [metric space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/metric_space). The **completion** of $X$ is the [complete metric space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/complete_metric_space) $(\tilde X, \tilde \rho)$ such that $X$ is a [dense](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/dense) subset of $\tilde X$ and $\rho(x,y) = \tilde\rho(x,y)$ for all $x,y \in X$ as constructed [here](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/completion_of_a_metric_space).
