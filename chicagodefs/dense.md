Let $X$ be a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space). A set $A \subset X$ is **dense** in $X$ if every point in $x$ is either in $A$ or is a [limit point](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/limit_point) of $A$. Equivalently, $A$ is dense in $X$ if its [closure](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/closure) is all of $X$.
