 title: action of a group on quotient by subgroup
 permalink: /action_of_a_group_on_quotient_by_subgroup
---Let $G$ be a [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) with [subgroup](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/subgroup) $H$ and let $G/H$ be the [quotient](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/quotient_by_subgroup) of $G$ by $H$. Then $G$ [acts](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group_action) on $H$ in a natural way: for all $Z = aH \in G/H$, $g\cdot Z = gZ = (ga)H$.
