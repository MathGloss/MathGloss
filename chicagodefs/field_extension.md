A [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field) $E$ is a **field extension** of the [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field) $F$ if $F$ is a [subfield](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/subfield) of $E$. 

The field extension may be considered as a [vector space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/vector_space) over $F$. The [dimension](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/dimension_of_vector_space) of $E$ as an $F$-[vector space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/vector_space) is denoted $[E:F]$, $\deg(E/F)$, or $\deg_F(E)$.

The most basic field extension comes from adjoining an element $\Theta$ to $F$. It is denoted $F(\Theta)$, and it is the smallest [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field) containing both $F$ and $\Theta$.
