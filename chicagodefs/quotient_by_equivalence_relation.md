Let $\sim$ be an [equivalence relation](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/equivalence_relation) on the set $S$. The **quotient** of $S$ by $\sim$ (denoted $S/\sim$) is the set of [equivalence classes](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/equivalence_class) of elements of $S$ with respect to $\sim$.
