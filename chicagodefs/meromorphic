---A function $f:U\to\mathbb C$ where $U$ is an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) subset of $\mathbb C$ is **meromorphic** if it is [holomorphic](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/holomorphic) on all of $U$ except for at a set of [isolated points](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/isolated_point), at each of which $f$ has a [pole](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/pole).
