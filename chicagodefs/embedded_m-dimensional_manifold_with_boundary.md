Let $m< n$. Then an **$m$-dimensional smooth manifold embedded in $\mathbb R^n$ with boundary** is a subset $M \subset\mathbb R^n$ such that for all points $p \in M$, there exists an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) set $U \subset H^k$ the [closed half-space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/closed_half-space) and an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/subspace_topology) neighborhood $V \subset M$ of $p$ and a map $\phi: U \to V$ such that 
1. $\phi$ is a [homeomorphism](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/homeomorphism)
2. $\phi$ is [smooth](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/smooth) in $H^k$ ( todo: what is this exactly?)
3. the [total derivative](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/differentiable) $D\phi(x)$ has rank $m$ for all $x \in U$.
