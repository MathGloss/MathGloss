---A [subspace](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/subspace_topology) $U$ of a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $X$ is **polygonally connected** if it is [path-connected](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/path-connected) via a [polygonal path](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/polygonal_path).

In the [complex numbers](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/complex_numbers), we can restrict to only "vertical" and "horizontal" lines.
