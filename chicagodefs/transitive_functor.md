In light of the [functorial](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/functor) definition of [group actions](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group_action), we can think of a covariant [functor](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/functor) $T:\mathcal B\to \mathcal S$ from a [small](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/small_category) [groupoid](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/groupoid) to the [category of sets](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/category_of_sets) as a generalization of a [group action](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group_action).

For each object $b$ of $\mathcal B$, $T$ restricts to an [action](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/#############action) of the [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) $\pi(\mathcal B,b)$[^1]. Then $T$ is **transitive** if this [group action](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group_action) is [transitive transitive](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/transitive_#############transitive) for all objects $b$. 

Note that if $\mathcal B$ is [connected](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/connected_category), if the restriction of $T$ on $\pi(\mathcal B,b)$ is [transitive transitive](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/transitive_#############transitive) for one object $b$ then it is transitive for all objects $b$.

[^1]: Note that $\pi(\mathcal B,b)$ denotes the [automorphism group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/automorphism_group) of $b$ as in the definition of [star of an object](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/star_of_an_object).
