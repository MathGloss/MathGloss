Let $\mathcal C$ be a [category](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/category) and $x$ an object of $\mathcal C$. The [category](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/category) $x/\mathcal C$ of **objects under $x$**  has objects given by the morphisms $f:x\to y$ in $\mathcal C$. For objects $f:x\to y$ and $g:x\to z$ in $x/\mathcal C$, the morphisms $\gamma:f\to g$ are the morphisms $\gamma y\to z$ in $\mathcal C$ such that $\gamma\circ f = g:x\to z$. Composition and the [identity maps](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/identity_function) are given by composition and the identity maps in $\mathcal C$.

When $\mathcal C$ is a [groupoid](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/groupoid), $\gamma = g\circ f^{-1}$ and the objects of $x/\mathcal C$ therefore determine the [category](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/category).
