A **homeomorphism** between two [topological spaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $X$ and $Y$ is a function $f: X\to Y$ such that 
1. $f$ is [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous).
2. $f$ is [bijective](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/bijective).
3. $f^{-1}:Y\to X$ is [continuous](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/continuous).

Two [topological spaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/##################topological_spaces) $X$ and $Y$ are **homeomorphic** if there exists a homeomorphism between them.
