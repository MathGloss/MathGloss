The **order** of a [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) $G$ is the [cardinal number](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/cardinal_number) of the [underlying set](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/forgetful_functor) of $G$. The order of a group does not distinguish between different infinite cardinals.
