Let $L$ be a [Lie algebra](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/Lie_algebra) and $I\subset L$ an [ideal](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ideal_of_a_Lie_algebra). Then the **quotient** $L / I$ is constructed as follows:
- The underlying [vector space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/vector_space) is the usual [quotient vector space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/quotient_vector_space) $L/I$ when $L$ and $I$ are considered as [vector spaces](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/vector_space). 
- Lie multiplication is given by $[x+I,y+I] = [xy]+I$.
