Let $X$ be a [based](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/based_topological_space) [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) and let $I$ be the unit [interval](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/interval). The **reduced cone** on $X$ is the [smash product](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/smash_product) $$CX = X\wedge I$$ where $I$ has as its basepoint $1$. Explicitly, $$CX = (X\times I)/((\{*\}\times I) \cup (X\times\{1\})).$$ 

The usual **cone** is done without [identifying](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/quotient_of_topological_spaces) the line $\{*\}\times I$ through the basepoint of $X$ to a point.
