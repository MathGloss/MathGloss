The displayed natural isomorphisms restrict to the category $\textup{\textsf{Fin}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$ of finite sets and bijections, a category which serves as the domain for the cardinality functor $|-|: \textup{\textsf{Fin}}_{\mathrm{iso}} \to \mathbb{N}$, whose codomain is the discrete category of natural numbers.\footnote{Mathematical invariants often take the form of a functor from a groupoid to a discrete category.} Writing $a=|A|$, $b=|B|$, and $c=|C|$, the cardinality functor carries these natural isomorphisms to the equations
 a \times (b +c) &= (a \times b) + (a \times c) & && (a\times b)^c &= a^c \times b^c \\ a^{b +c} &= a^b \times a^c & &&  (a^b)^c &= a^{(b \times c)}
 through a process called **decategorification**. Reversing directions, $\textup{\textsf{Fin}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$ is a **categorification** of the natural numbers, which reveals that the familiar laws of arithmetic follow from more fundamental natural isomorphisms between various constructions on sets. A slick proof of each of the displayed natural isomorphisms \eqref{eq:arithmetic} appears in Corollary \ref{cor:arithmetic}.
