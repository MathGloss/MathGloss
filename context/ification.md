Objects in $\textup{\textsf{cgHaus}}$ are **compactly generated Hausdorff spaces**: Hausdorff spaces $X$ with the property that any subset $A \subset X$ that intersects each compact subset $K \subset X$ in a closed subset $A \cap K$ is itself closed in $X$.
 The inclusion $\textup{\textsf{cgHaus}}\hookrightarrow\textup{\textsf{Haus}}$ has a right adjoint $k : \textup{\textsf{Haus}} \to \textup{\textsf{cgHaus}}$ called $k$-**ification**: the space $k(X)$ refines the topology on $X$ by adding to the collection of closed sets those subsets $A \subset X$ whose intersections with all compact subsets $K$ are closed.

SUGGESTION: compactly generated Hausdorff space
