In this case,  $s$ is always a monomorphism and, dually, $r$ is always an epimorphism. To acknowledge the presence of these one-sided inverses, $s$ is said to be a **split monomorphism** and $r$ is said to be a **split epimorphism**.\footnote{The axiom of choice asserts that every epimorphism in the category of sets is a split epimorphism.}


SUGGESTION: split monomorphism
