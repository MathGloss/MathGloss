-  There is a contravariant functor $\textup{Spec} : \textup{\textsf{CRing}}^\mathrm{op} \to \textup{\textsf{Top}}$ that sends a commutative ring $R$ to its set $\textup{Spec}(R)$ of prime ideals given the **Zariski topology**. The closed subsets in the Zariski topology are those subsets $V_I \subset \textup{Spec}(R)$ of prime ideals containing a fixed ideal $I \subset R$. This construction is contravariantly functorial: for any ring homomorphism $\phi : R \to S$ and prime ideal $\mathfrak{p} \subset S$, the inverse image $\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{p}) \subset R$ defines a prime ideal of $R$, and the inverse image function $\phi^{-1} : \textup{Spec}(S) \to \textup{Spec}(R)$ is continuous with respect to the Zariski topology.
