 A **terminal object** is often regarded as a trivial special case of a product, where the indexing category is empty. A cone over an empty diagram is just an object in the target category, its summit, together with no additional data. Any morphism between the summits defines a map of empty cones. Thus, the category of cones in this special case is just the ambient category itself and so the limit, a terminal object in this category, is just a terminal object in the sense of Definition \ref{defn:initial-terminal}.


SUGGESTION: terminal object
