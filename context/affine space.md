 An **affine space** is an **algebra** for the affine linear combination monad $\textup{Aff}_\mathbbe{k}(-) : \textup{\textsf{Set}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$.\footnote{While the traditional definition requires an affine space to be inhabited, this definition is a mild generalization, including the empty set as an example.}


SUGGESTION: affine space
