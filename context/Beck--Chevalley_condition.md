The argument presented here, due to Par\'e \cite{Pare-colimits}, also  holds when $\textup{\textsf{Set}}$ is replaced by any \emph{elementary topos} (a further generalization of the Grothendieck toposes introduced in \S\ref{sec:topos}). It makes use of the following lemma, whose conclusion is sometimes called the **Beck--Chevalley condition**, that asserts that for certain commutative squares, the induced direct and inverse image functions on power sets commute:
