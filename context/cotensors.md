 Iterated products of an object $A \in \mathsf{C}$ are called **powers** or **cotensors**. For a set $I$, the $I$-indexed power of $A$ is denoted $\prod_I A$ or $A^I$.
The representable universal property is expressed by the natural isomorphism
$ \mathsf{C}(X,A^I) \mathrm{co}ng \mathsf{C} (X,A)^I\rlap{{\,},}$ i.e., a map $h : X \to A^I$ is determined by an $I$-indexed family of maps $h_i : X \to A$ defined by composing with each product projection $\epsilon_i : A^I \to A$. In the case of $\mathsf{C}= \textup{\textsf{Set}}$, this notation is consistent with the exponential notation introduced previously: the power $A^I$ is isomorphic to the set of functions from $I$ to $A$, and the map $\epsilon_i : A^I \to A$ evaluates each function at $i \in I$.
