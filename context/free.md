A functor $E : \mathsf{B} G \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$, i.e., a left $G$-set $E$, is representable if and only if there is an isomorphism $G \mathrm{co}ng E$ of left $G$-sets. This implies that the action of $G$ on $E$ is **free** (every stabilizer group is trivial) and **transitive** (the orbit of any point is the entire set), and that $E$ is non-empty. Conversely, any non-empty free and transitive left $G$-set is representable; a proof is given in Example \ref{ex:torsor-represented}. By the Yoneda lemma, the data of a representation for $E$, i.e., a specific isomorphism $G \mathrm{co}ng E$, is determined by the choice of an element $e \in E$, the universal element, serving as the image of the identity $e \in G$. In other words, a representable left $G$-set $E$ is a group that has forgotten its identity element. A representable $G$-set is called a $G$-**torsor**.

SUGGESTION: free left G-set
