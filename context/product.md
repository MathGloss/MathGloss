 $}A **product** is a limit of a diagram indexed by a discrete category, with only identity morphisms. A diagram in $\mathsf{C}$ indexed by a discrete category  $J$ is simply a collection of objects $F_j \in \mathsf{C}$ indexed by $j \in J$. A cone over this diagram is a $J$-indexed family of morphisms $(\lambda_j : c \to F_j)_{j \in J}$, subject to no further constraints. The limit is typically denoted by $\prod_{j \in J} F_j $ and the legs of the limit cone are maps $\left(\pi_k : \prod_{j \in J} F_j \to F_k\right)_{k \in J}$ called **(product) projections**. The universal property asserts that composition with the product projections defines a natural isomorphism
$ \xymatrix{ \mathsf{C}(c,\prod_{j \in J} F_j ) \ar[r]^-{(\pi_k)_*}_-{\mathrm{co}ng} & \prod_{k \in J} \mathsf{C}(c,F_k) \mathrm{co}ng \textup{Cone}(c,F).}$
