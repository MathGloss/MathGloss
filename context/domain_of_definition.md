These examples aside, the notion of isomorphism of categories is somewhat unnatural. To illustrate, consider the category ^\partial$, of sets and partially-defined functions}$\textup{\textsf{Set}}^\partial$ of sets and partially-defined functions. A **partial function** $f: X \to Y$ is a function from a (possibly-empty) subset $X' \subset X$ to $Y$; the subset $X'$ is the **domain of definition** of the partial function $f$. The composite of two partial functions $f : X \to Y$ and $g : Y \to Z$ is the partial function whose domain of definition is the intersection of the domain of definition of $f$ with the preimage of the domain of definition of $g$.

SUGGESTION: domain of definition of a partial function
