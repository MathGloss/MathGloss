A category is **abelian** if
1. it has a **zero object** $0$, that is both initial and terminal,
2. it has all binary products and binary coproducts,
3. it has all **kernels** and **cokernels**, defined respectively to be the equalizer and coequalizer of a map $f \colon A \to B$ with the zero map $A \to 0 \to B$, and
4. all monomorphisms and epimorphisms arise as kernels or cokernels, respectively.
