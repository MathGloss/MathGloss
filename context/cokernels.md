 A category is **abelian** if

-  it has a **zero object** $0$, that is both initial and terminal,
-  it has all binary products and binary coproducts,
-  it has all **kernels** and **cokernels**, defined respectively to be the equalizer and coequalizer of a map $f : A \to B$ with the zero map $A \to 0 \to B$, and
-  all monomorphisms and epimorphisms arise as kernels or cokernels, respectively.



SUGGESTION: cokernel
