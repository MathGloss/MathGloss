[\textnormal{a convenient category of spaces}] The category $\textup{\textsf{Top}}$ is not cartesian closed. However, a famous paper of Steenrod proves that there exists a **convenient category of topological spaces** that is complete, cocomplete, cartesian closed, and sufficiently large so as to contain the CW complexes  \cite{steenrodconvenient}. Steenrod's convenient category is a subcategory of the category $, of Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps}$\textup{\textsf{Haus}}$ of Hausdorff spaces and continuous functions. Previous researchers had argued that a ``convenient category of spaces'' satisfying Steenrod's list of conditions did not exist, but Steenrod notes:

The arguments are based on a blind adherence to the customary definitions of the standard operations. These definitions are suitable for the category of Hausdorff spaces, but they need not be for a subcategory. The categorical viewpoint enables us to defrost these definitions and bend them a bit.

What he means is that the  ``product'' on a yet-to-be-defined subcategory    $, of compactly generated Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps}$\textup{\textsf{cgHaus}}$ should be the categorical product of Definition \ref{defn:product}, which, as it turns out, is not  preserved by the full inclusion $\textup{\textsf{cgHaus}}\hookrightarrow\textup{\textsf{Haus}}$.
