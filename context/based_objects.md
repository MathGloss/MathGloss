 For a concrete category $\mathsf{C}$, the objects in the category of elements for the forgetful functor $U : \mathsf{C} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ are elements $x \in Uc$ in the underlying set of a specified object $c \in \mathsf{C}$. Morphisms are maps in $\mathsf{C}$ whose underlying functions preserve the chosen elements. Extending previous notation introduced in certain special cases, it would be reasonable to write $\mathsf{C}_*$ for $\textstyle{\int}\!{U}$ and refer to the category of elements as the category of **based objects** in $\mathsf{C}$.


SUGGESTION: based object
