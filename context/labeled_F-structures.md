Combinatorialists refer to a functor $F: \textup{\textsf{Fin}}_{\mathrm{iso}} \to \textup{\textsf{Fin}}$ as a **species**.\footnote{In this context, ``species'' is singular.} The image $F(n)$ of the $n$-element set $n$ is the set of **labeled $F$-structures** on $n$. The set of **unlabeled $F$-structures** on $n$ is defined by restricting  $\textup{\textsf{Fin}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$ to the full subcategory spanned by the $n$-element set, i.e., to the symmetric group $\Sigma_n$ regarded as the group of automorphisms of the object $n \in \textup{\textsf{Fin}}_{\mathrm{iso}}$, and forming the colimit of the diagram $\mathsf{B}\Sigma_n \hookrightarrow \textup{\textsf{Fin}}_{\mathrm{iso}} \xrightarrow{F} \textup{\textsf{Fin}}\rlap{,}}$ Because $\textup{Ord}$ and $\textup{Sym}$ are objectwise isomorphic, the sets of labeled $\textup{Sym}$-structures and labeled $\textup{Ord}$-structures are isomorphic. However, the set of unlabeled $\textup{Sym}$-structures on $n$ is the set of conjugacy classes of permutations of $n$-elements, while the set of unlabeled $\textup{Ord}$-structures on $n$ is trivial: all linear orders on $n$ are isomorphic. See \cite{joyal-species} for more.
