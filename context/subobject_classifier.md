-  The objects in the category of elements of the contravariant power set functor are pairs $A' \subset A$, a set with a chosen subset. A morphism $f : (A' \subset A) \to (B' \subset B)$ is a function $f : A \to B$ so that $f^{-1}(B') = A'$. The terminal object, corresponding to the representation described in Example \ref{exs:contra-rep}\eqref{itm:contra-rep-power}, is the set $\Omega :eqq \{\top,\bot\}$ of two elements  with the distinguished singleton subset $\{ \top\} \subset \Omega$. This is the universal set equipped with a subset.\footnote{In the \emph{topos} of sets, $\{ \top\} \subset \Omega$ is called the **subobject classifier**; see \S\ref{sec:topos}.} For any $A' \subset A$, there is a unique function $h : A \to \Omega$ so that $h^{-1}(\top) = A'$. Note that even if we begin with a skeletal category of sets, $\{\top\} \subset \Omega$ is not the unique terminal object in the category of elements. It is isomorphic to $\{\bot\} \subset \Omega$.
