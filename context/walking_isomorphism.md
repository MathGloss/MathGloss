-  The functor $\textup{iso} : \textup{\textsf{Cat}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ that takes a small category to its set of isomorphisms (pointing in a specified direction) is represented by the category $\mathbb{I}$, with two objects and exactly one morphism in each hom-set. In this sense, the category $\mathbb{I}$ is the **free** or **walking isomorphism**.

SUGGESTION: walking isomorphism
