-  The free $\dashv$ forgetful adjunction between sets and groups induces the **free group monad** $F : \textup{\textsf{Set}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ that sends a set $A$ to the set $F(A)$ of finite words in the letters $a \in A$ together with formal inverses $a^{-1}$.

SUGGESTION: free group monad
