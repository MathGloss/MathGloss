-  For any unital ring $R$, the forgetful functor $U : \textup{\textsf{Mod}}_R \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ is represented by the $R$-module $R$. That is, there is a natural bijection between $R$-module homomorphisms $R \to M$ and elements of the underlying set of $M$, in which $m \in UM$ is associated to the unique $R$-module homomorphism that carries the multiplicative identity of $R$ to $m$; this is to say, $R$ is the **free $R$-module on a single generator**. This explains the appearance of the abelian group $\mathbb{Z}$ and the vector space $\mathbbe{k}$ in Definition \ref{defn:monoid-cases}, where maps with these domains were used to specify elements in the codomains.

SUGGESTION: free R-module on a single generator
