For example, a large variety of categories whose objects are sets equipped with some sort of ``algebraic'' structure are locally finitely presentable (meaning locally $\omega$-presentable); see Definition \ref{defn:model-AT}. A locally $\kappa$-presentable category is also locally $\lambda$-presentable for any $ \lambda > \kappa$. Between **locally presentable categories**, meaning categories that are locally $\kappa$-presentable for some $\kappa$, the adjoint functor theorem takes a particularly appealing form.
