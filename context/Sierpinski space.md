-  The functor $\mathcal{O} : \textup{\textsf{Top}}^\mathrm{op} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ that sends a space to its set of open subsets is represented by the **Sierpinski space** $S$, the topological space with two points, one closed and one open. The natural bijection $\textup{\textsf{Top}}(X,S) \mathrm{co}ng \mathcal{O}(X)$ associates a continuous function $X \to S$ to the preimage of the open point. This bijection is natural because a composite function $Y \to X \to S$ classifies the preimage of the open subset of $X$ under the function $Y \to X$.

SUGGESTION: Sierpinski space
