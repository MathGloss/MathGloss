Theorems, such as \ref{thm:colimit-construction} and \ref{thm:finite-colimit-construction}, that reduce the construction of general limits and colimits to a handful of simple ones are particularly useful when it comes to proving that a category is **complete** or **cocomplete**---that is, has all small limits or colimits---or that a functor is **continuous** or **cocontinuous**---that is, preserves all small limits or colimits. The proofs
reduce to checking a few cases. In this section, we describe the constructions of limits and colimits in various categories, in most cases leaving the proofs that these constructions have the claimed universal properties to the reader.
