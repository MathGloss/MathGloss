Recall that a limit-preserving functor is called **continuous**; a colimit-preserving functor is called **cocontinuous**. Lemma \ref{lem:adjoint-criterion} reduces the problem of finding a left adjoint to a continuous functor $U : \mathsf{A} \to \mathsf{S}$ to the problem of finding an initial object in the comma category $s \mathrm{co}mma U$ defined for each $s \in \mathsf{S}$. This comma category, as the category of elements for $\mathsf{S}(s,U-) : \mathsf{A} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$, comes with a canonical forgetful functor $\Pi: s \mathrm{co}mma U \to \mathsf{A}$ that carries an object $s \to Ua$ to the object $a$.

SUGGESTION: cocontinuous functor
