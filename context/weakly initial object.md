Consider a limit cone $(\lambda_c : \ell \to c)_{c \in \mathsf{C}}$. The legs of the limit cone demonstrate that $\ell$ is a **weakly initial object**, admitting at least one morphism to every object $c \in \mathsf{C}$. To show that $\lambda_c$ is the only morphism from $\ell$ to $c$, observe that for any  morphism $f : \ell \to c$, commutativity of the limit cone implies that $f \lambda_\ell = \lambda_c$. So to prove that $\ell$ is initial, it suffices to show that the cone leg $\lambda_\ell : \ell \to \ell$ is the identity.

SUGGESTION: weakly initial object
