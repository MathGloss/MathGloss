-  $(-)^\times : \textup{\textsf{Ring}} \to \textup{\textsf{Group}}$, carrying a ring to its group of units. The free ring on a group $G$ is the **group ring** $\mathbb{Z}[G] = \scalebox{0.85}{\ensuremath{\textstyle\bigoplus}}_G \mathbb{Z}$, whose elements are finite formal sums of group elements, using the group operation to define the bilinear multiplication law.
