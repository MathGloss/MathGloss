A guiding principle in category theory is that categorically-defined concepts should be equivalence invariant. Some category theorists go so far as to call a definition ``evil'' if it is not invariant under equivalence of categories. The only evil definitions that have been introduced thus far are smallness and discreteness. A category is **essentially small** if it is equivalent to a small category or, equivalently, if its skeleton is a small category. A category is **essentially discrete** if it is equivalent to a discrete category.
