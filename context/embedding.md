 Fullness and faithfulness are \emph{local} conditions; a \emph{global} condition, by contrast, applies ``everywhere.'' A faithful functor need not be injective on morphisms; neither must a full functor be surjective on morphisms.   A faithful functor that is injective on objects is called an **embedding** and identifies the domain category as a subcategory of the codomain; in this case, faithfulness implies that the functor is (globally) injective on arrows.  A full and faithful functor, called  **fully faithful** for short, that is injective-on-objects defines a **full embedding** of the domain category into the codomain category. The domain then defines a **full subcategory** of the codomain.
