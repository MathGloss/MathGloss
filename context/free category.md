 The forgetful functor $U : \textup{\textsf{Cat}} \to \textup{\textsf{DirGraph}}$ admits a left adjoint $F$, defining the **free category** on a directed graph. A **directed graph** $G$ consists of a set $V$ of vertices, a set $E$ of edges, and two functions $s,t : E \rightrightarrows V$ defining the source and target of each directed edge. The free category on $G$ has $V$ as its set of objects. The set of morphisms consists of identities for each vertex together with finite ``paths'' of edges. Composition is defined by concatenation of paths.
