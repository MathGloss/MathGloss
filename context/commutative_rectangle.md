 Consider $\mathbbe{2} \times \mathbbe{3}$, the category with six objects and the displayed non-identity morphisms
$ \xymatrix{ \bullet \ar[d] \ar[r] \ar[dr] \ar[drr]  \ar@/^1.5ex/[rr] & \bullet \ar[d] \ar[r] \ar[dr] & \bullet \ar[d] \\ \bullet \ar[r]  \ar@/_1.5ex/[rr] & \bullet \ar[r] & \bullet}$ The long diagonal asserts that the outer triples of composable morphisms have a common composite, i.e., that the outer rectangle commutes. The short diagonals assert, respectively, that the left-hand and right-hand squares commute. The inner parallelogram also commutes. A diagram indexed by $\mathbbe{2} \times \mathbbe{3}$, typically drawn without any of the diagonals, is a **commutative rectangle**.
