Note that a monomorphism or epimorphism in $\mathsf{C}$ is, respectively, an epimorphism or monomorphism in $\mathsf{C}^\mathrm{op}$. In adjectival form, a monomorphism is **monic** and an epimorphism is **epic**. In common shorthand, a monomorphism is a }**mono** and an epimorphism is an }**epi**.  For graphical emphasis, monos are often decorated with a tail ``$\rightarrowtail$'' while epis may be decorated at their head ``$\twoheadrightarrow$.''

SUGGESTION: epic morphism
