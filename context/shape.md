Recall that a **diagram** of **shape** $\mathsf{J}$ in a category $\mathsf{C}$ is a functor $F : \mathsf{J} \to \mathsf{C}$.  Our aim in this section is to introduce the dual notions of \emph{limit} and \emph{colimit} of a diagram, which are defined, respectively, to be the universal \emph{cones} over and under the diagram. The first task is to explain what is meant by a cone.

SUGGESTION: cone over a diagram
