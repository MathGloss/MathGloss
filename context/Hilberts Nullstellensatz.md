The unit and counit encode relations $ T \subset V(I(T))\quad \text{and}\quad S \subset I(V(S))\rlap{{\,}.}$  A set of points $T \subset \mathbbe{k}^n$ defines a fixed point $T = V(I(T))$ if and only if $T$ is closed in the Zariski topology on $\mathbbe{k}^n = \textup{Spec}(\mathbbe{k}[x_1,\ldots, x_n])$, introduced in Example \ref{exs:contra-functors}\eqref{itm:Zariski}. A set of polynomials $S \subset \mathbbe{k}[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ defines a fixed point $S = I(V(S))$ if and only if $S$ defines a radical ideal of $\mathbbe{k}[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$; this is **Hilbert's Nullstellensatz**. Exercise \ref{exc:equiv-in-adjoint} now implies that the poset of Zariski closed subsets of $\mathbbe{k}^n$ is isomorphic to the opposite of the poset of radical ideals of $\mathbbe{k}[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$.
