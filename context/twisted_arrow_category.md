 For a locally small category $\mathsf{C}$, regard the two-sided represented functor $\mathrm{Hom}(-,-) : \mathsf{C}^\mathrm{op} \times \mathsf{C} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ as a covariant functor of its domain $\mathsf{C}^\mathrm{op} \times \mathsf{C}$. The category of elements of $\mathrm{Hom}$ is called the **twisted arrow category**. Justify this name by describing its objects and morphisms.
