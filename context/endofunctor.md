-  There is an endofunctor\footnote{An **endofunctor** is a functor whose domain is equal to its codomain.} $P : \textup{\textsf{Set}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ that sends a set $A$ to its power set $PA = \{ A' \subset A\}$ and a function $f : A \to B$ to the direct-image function $f_* : PA \to PB$ that sends $A' \subset A$ to $f(A') \subset B$.

SUGGESTION: endofunctor
