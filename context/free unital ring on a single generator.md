-  The functor $U : \textup{\textsf{Ring}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ is represented by the unital ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]$, the polynomial ring in one variable with integer coefficients. A unital ring homomorphism $\mathbb{Z}[x] \to R$ is uniquely determined by the image of $x$; put another way, $\mathbb{Z}[x]$ is the **free unital ring on a single generator**.

SUGGESTION: free unital ring on a single generator
