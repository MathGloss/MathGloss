Thus, the philosophy of category theory is extended. The categories listed in Example \ref{exs:concrete-categories} suggest that  mathematical objects ought to be considered together with the appropriate notion of morphism between them. The categories listed in Example \ref{exs:abstract-categories} illustrate that these morphisms are not always functions.\footnote{Reid's \emph{Undergraduate algebraic geometry} emphasizes that the morphisms are not  always functions, writing ``Students who disapprove are recommended to give up at once and take a reading course in category theory instead'' \cite[p.~4]{reid-undergraduate}.} The morphisms in a category are also called **arrows** or **maps**, particularly in the contexts of Examples  \ref{exs:abstract-categories} and \ref{exs:concrete-categories}, respectively.

SUGGESTION: arrows
