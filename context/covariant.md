An easy application of the Yoneda lemma completely characterizes natural transformations between representable functors: any locally small category $\mathsf{C}$ is isomorphic to the full subcategory of $\textup{\textsf{Set}}^{\mathsf{C}^\mathrm{op}}$ spanned by the contravariant represented functors, and $\mathsf{C}^\mathrm{op}$ is isomorphic to the full subcategory of $\textup{\textsf{Set}}^{\mathsf{C}}$ spanned by the covariant represented functors, via the canonically-defined **covariant** and **contravariant Yoneda embeddings**.

SUGGESTION: covariant functor
