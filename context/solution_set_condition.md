[\textnormal{General Adjoint Functor Theorem}] Let $U : \mathsf{A} \to \mathsf{S}$ be a continuous functor whose domain is locally small and complete. Suppose that $U$ satisfies the following **solution set condition**:

-  For every $s \in \mathsf{S}$ there exists a set of morphisms $\Phi_s = \{f_i : s \to Ua_i\}$ so that any $f : s \to Ua$ factors through some $f_i \in \Phi_s$ along a morphism $a_i \to a$ in $\mathsf{A}$.

Then $U$ admits a left adjoint.
