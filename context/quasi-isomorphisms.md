 There are two homotopical structures of interest on the category $\textup{\textsf{Ch}}_R$ of chain complexes of $R$-modules. In the first, the class of weak equivalences is taken to be the chain homotopy equivalences. In the second, the class of weak equivalences is enlarged to contain all **quasi-isomorphisms**, that is, chain maps $f : A_\bullet \to B_\bullet$ that induce an isomorphism on graded abelian groups after applying the homology functor introduced in Example \ref{exs:functor}\eqref{itm:homology}.


SUGGESTION: quasi-isomorphism
