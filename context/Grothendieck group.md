-  $\textup{\textsf{Ab}}\hookrightarrow\textup{\textsf{CMonoid}}$, the inclusion of abelian groups into the category of commutative monoids.$, of commutative monoids and homomorphisms} The left adjoint $\textup{Gr}$ carries a commutative monoid $(M,+,0)$ to its **group completion**, also called the **Grothendieck group**: as a set $\textup{Gr}(M,+,0)$ is the quotient of $M \times M$ by the relation $(a,b) \simeq (a',b')$ if and only if there is some $c \in M$ so that $a + b' + c = a' + b +c$.

SUGGESTION: Grothendieck group
