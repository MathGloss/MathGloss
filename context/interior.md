For example, the poset $PX$ of subsets of a topological space $X$ admits a closure operator $TA = \overline{A}$, where $\overline{A}$ is the closure of $A \subset X$, and a kernel operator $KA = A^\circ$, where $A^\circ$ is the interior of $A \subset X$.\footnote{The **closure** of $A$ is the smallest closed set containing $A$, equally the intersection of all closed sets containing $A$; the **interior** is defined dually.}


SUGGESTION: interior of a set
