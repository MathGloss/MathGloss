In 1941, Saunders Mac Lane gave a lecture at the University of Michigan in which he computed for a prime $p$ that $\mathrm{Ext}(\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{p}]/\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z})\mathrm{co}ng\mathbb{Z}_p$, the group of $p$-adic integers, where $\mathbb{Z}[\frac{1}{p}]/\mathbb{Z}$ is the fer $p$-group}Pr\"{u}fer $p$-group. When he explained this result to Samuel Eilenberg, who had missed the lecture, Eilenberg recognized the calculation as the homology of the 3-sphere complement of the $p$-adic solenoid, a space formed as the infinite intersection of a sequence of solid tori, each wound around $p$ times inside the preceding torus.  In teasing apart this connection, the pair of them discovered what is now known as the **universal coefficient theorem** in algebraic topology, which relates the \emph{homology} $H_*$ and \emph{cohomology groups} $H^*$ associated to a space $X$ via a group extension \cite{maclane-autobiography}:
 0 \to \mathrm{Ext}(H_{n-1}(X),G) \to H^n(X,G) \to \mathrm{Hom}(H_n(X),G) \to 0\rlap{{\,}.}
