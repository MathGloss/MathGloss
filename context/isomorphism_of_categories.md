The category of categories gives rise to a notion of an **isomorphism of categories**, defined by interpreting Definition \ref{defn:iso} in $\textup{\textsf{Cat}}$ or in $\textup{\textsf{CAT}}$. Namely, an isomorphism of categories is given by a pair of inverse functors $F : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}$ and $G : \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}$ so that the composites $GF$ and $FG$, respectively, equal the identity functors on $\mathsf{C}$ and on $\mathsf{D}$. An isomorphism induces a bijection between the objects of $\mathsf{C}$ and objects of $\mathsf{D}$ and likewise for the morphisms.
