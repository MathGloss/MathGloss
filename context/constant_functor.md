For any object $c \in \mathsf{C}$ and any  category $\mathsf{J}$, the **constant functor** $c : \mathsf{J} \to \mathsf{C}$ sends every object of $\mathsf{J}$ to $c$ and every morphism in $\mathsf{J}$ to the identity morphism $1_c$. The constant functors define an embedding $\Delta : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{C}^{\mathsf{J}}$ that sends an object $c$ to the constant functor at $c$ and a morphism $f : c \to c'$ to the **constant natural transformation**, in which each component is defined to be the morphism $f$.
