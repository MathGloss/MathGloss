-  The functor $\mathcal{O} : \textup{\textsf{Top}}^\mathrm{op} \to \textup{\textsf{Poset}}$ that carries a space $X$ to its poset (X)$}(X)$, the poset of open subsets of a space $X$ under inclusion}$\mathcal{O}(X)$ of open subsets is contravariant on the category of spaces: a continuous map $f : X \to Y$ gives rise to a function $f^{-1} : \mathcal{O}(Y) \to \mathcal{O}(X)$ that carries an open subset $U \subset Y$ to its preimage $f^{-1}(U)$, which is open in $X$; this is the definition of **continuity**. A similar functor $\mathcal{C} : \textup{\textsf{Top}}^\mathrm{op} \to \textup{\textsf{Poset}}$ carries a space to its poset of closed subsets.

SUGGESTION: continuity
