 Given an adjunction $F \dashv G$, there is a natural transformation $\epsilon : FG \Rightarrow 1_\mathsf{D}$, called the **counit** of the adjunction, whose component $\epsilon_d : FGd \to d$ at $d$ is defined to be the transpose of the identity morphism $1_{Gd}$.


SUGGESTION: counit of the adjunction
