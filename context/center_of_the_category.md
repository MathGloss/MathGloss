Show that for any category $\mathsf{C}$, the collection of natural endomorphisms of the identity functor $1_\mathsf{C}$ defines a commutative monoid, called the **center of the category**. The proof of Proposition \ref{prop:unnatural-torsion} demonstrates that the center of $\textup{\textsf{cat}}_{\mathrm{fg}}$ is the multiplicative monoid $(\mathbb{Z},\times,1)$.
