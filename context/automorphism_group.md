-  the **automorphism group** $\mathrm{Aut}(G)$, the group of isomorphisms $\phi : G \to G$ in $\textup{\textsf{Group}}$.

Trivially, all three constructions define a functor from the discrete category of groups (with only identity morphisms) to $\textup{\textsf{Group}}$. Are these constructions functorial in
