Somewhat surprisingly, the particular construction of total derived functors via deformations given in Proposition \ref{prop:left-derived} implies that the total derived functors produced in this manner are pointwise and indeed **absolute Kan extensions**: not only are these Kan extensions preserved by representables but they are preserved  by all functors.

SUGGESTION: absolute Kan extension
