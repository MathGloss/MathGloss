By a theorem of Freyd \cite{freyd-real}, refined by Leinster \cite{leinster-self}, the structure on the unit interval that is used to define composition of paths also describes the universal property of this topological space. A **bipointed space** is a topological space $I$ with two distinct closed points $0 \neq 1 \in I$, one designated as the ``left'' and the other as the ``right.'' A map of bipointed spaces is a continuous function that sends the left point to the left point and the right point to the right point. For any bipointed space $(X,x_0,x_1)$, we can define $X \vee X$ to be the pushout
$ \xymatrix{ \ast \ar[d]_{x_1} \ar[r]^{x_0} \ar@{}[dr]|(.8){\displaystyle\ulcorner} & X \ar[d] \\ X \ar[r] & X \vee X}$

SUGGESTION: bipointed space
