[\textnormal{on generalized elements}]
A direct proof of Theorem \ref{thm:colimit-construction} simply constructs the diagram \eqref{eq:colimit-formula} in $\mathsf{C}$ and checks that the coequalizer of $c$ and $d$ has the universal property that defines $\mathrm{colim}_\mathsf{J} F$. There is a sense in which this direct proof is quite similar to our strategy---to first verify the result in $\textup{\textsf{Set}}$ and then apply representability---by something  called the **philosophy of generalized elements**, first articulated by Lawvere \cite{Lawvere-ETCS}.

SUGGESTION: philosophy of generalized elements
