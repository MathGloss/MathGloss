Both $\textup{\textsf{Cat}}$ and $\textup{\textsf{CAT}}$ are also cocomplete. Coproducts in each case are straightforward:  any category is uniquely expressible as a coproduct of its **connected components**. By Lemma \ref{lem:equalizer-as-pullback}, it suffices to construct pushouts. But these can be rather more complicated than was the case for the corresponding limit notions.

SUGGESTION: connected component
