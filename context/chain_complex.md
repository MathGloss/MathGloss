-  _R$, of chain complexes of $R$-modules and chain maps}$\textup{\textsf{Ch}}_R$ has chain complexes of $R$-modules as objects and chain homomorphisms as morphisms.\footnote{A **chain complex** $C_\bullet$ is a collection $(C_n)_{n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ of $R$-modules equipped with $R$-module homomorphisms $d : C_n \to C_{n-1}$, called **boundary homomorphisms**, with the property that $d^2=0$, i.e., the composite of any two boundary maps is the zero homomorphism. A map of chain complexes $f : C_\bullet \to C'_\bullet$ is comprised of a collection of homomorphisms $f_n : C_n \to C_n'$ so that $d f_n = f_{n-1} d$ for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$.}

SUGGESTION: chain complex of R-modules
