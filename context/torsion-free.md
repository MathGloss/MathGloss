Another familiar isomorphism that is not natural arises in the classification of finitely generated abelian groups, objects of a category _{\mathrm{fg}}$, of finitely generated abelian groups and homomorphisms}$\textup{\textsf{Ab}}_{\mathrm{fg}}$. Let $TA$ denote the **torsion subgroup** of an abelian group $A$, the subgroup of elements with finite order. In classifying finitely generated groups, one proves that every finitely generated abelian group $A$ is isomorphic to the direct sum $TA \mathrm{op}lus (A/TA)$, the summand $A/TA$ being the **torsion-free** part of $A$. However, these isomorphisms are not natural, as we now demonstrate.

SUGGESTION: torsion-free part
