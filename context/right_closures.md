Particularly, when $F : \mathsf{C} \times \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{C}$ defines some sort of monoidal product, its pointwise-defined right adjoints  $G$ and $H$ are called its  **left** and **right closures**, respectively. When these are isomorphic, the bifunctor $F$ is called **closed**.

SUGGESTION: right closure
