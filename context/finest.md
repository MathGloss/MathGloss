It remains to define the topology on the set $X \times Y$. Taking $A$ to be the set $X \times Y$ equipped with various topologies, this universal property forces $X \times Y$ to be defined to be the coarsest topology on the cartesian product of the underlying sets of $X$ and $Y$ so that the projection functions $\pi_X$ and $\pi_Y$ are continuous.\footnote{**Coarsest** means ``having the fewest open and closed sets''; the antonym is  **finest**, meaning ``having the most open and closed sets.''}

SUGGESTION: finest topology
