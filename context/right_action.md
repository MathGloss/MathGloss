The action specified by a functor $\mathsf{B} G \to \mathsf{C}$ is sometimes called a **left action**. A **right action** is a functor $\mathsf{B} G^\mathrm{op} \to \mathsf{C}$. As before, each $g \in G$ determines an endomorphism $g^* : X \to X$ in $\mathsf{C}$ and the identity element must act trivially. But now, for a pair of elements $g,h \in G$ these actions must satisfy the composition rule $(hg)^*=g^*h^*$.

SUGGESTION: right action
