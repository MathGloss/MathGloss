Now for each $\mu \in \Sigma(X)$, there is a linear functional $\phi_\mu : C(X) \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by $ \phi_\mu(g) :eqq \int_X g\ d \mu, \qquad g \in C(X)\rlap{,}}$ For each $\mu \in \Sigma(X)$,  $f : X \to Y$, and $h \in C(Y)$ the equation
$ \int_X hf\ d \mu = \int_Y h\ d (\mu \circ f^{-1})$ says that the assignment $\mu \mapsto \phi_\mu$ defines the components of a natural transformation $\eta : \Sigma \Rightarrow C^*$. The **Riesz representation theorem**  asserts that this natural transformation is a natural isomorphism; see \cite{Hartig-Riesz}.
