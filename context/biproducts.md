In an abelian category $\mathsf{A}$, finite products and finite coproducts coincide (in the sense that the canonical map from the latter to the former described in Remark \ref{rmk:direct-sum} is an isomorphism) and are called **biproducts** or **direct sums**. These axioms imply that the hom-sets in $\mathsf{A}$ canonically inherit the structure of an abelian group, with the zero map in each hom-set serving as the additive identity, in such a way that composition is bilinear. This gives $\mathsf{A}$ the structure of a category \emph{enriched over}\footnote{Ordinary categorical notions can be extended to categories in which each $\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)$ is an object of a general monoidal category $(\mathsf{V}, \otimes, *)$, in place of $(\textup{\textsf{Set}}, \times, *)$. See \cite[Chapter 3]{riehl-categorical} for an introduction to enriched category theory.} the monoidal category $(\textup{\textsf{Ab}},\otimes_\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{Z})$.
