A **subcategory** $\mathsf{D}$ of a category $\mathsf{C}$ is defined by restricting to a subcollection of objects and subcollection of morphisms subject to the requirements that the subcategory $\mathsf{D}$ contains the domain and codomain of any morphism in $\mathsf{D}$, the identity morphism of any object in $\mathsf{D}$, and the composite of any composable pair of morphisms in $\mathsf{D}$. For example, there is a subcategory $\textup{\textsf{CRing}} \subset \textup{\textsf{Ring}}$ $, of commutative unital rings and homomorphisms} of commutative unital rings. Both of these form subcategories of the category $, of non-unital rings and homomorphisms}$\textup{\textsf{Rng}}$ of not-necessarily unital rings and homomorphisms that need not preserve the multiplicative unit.\footnote{To justify our default notion of ring, see Poonen's ``Why all rings should have a 1'' \cite{poonen-why}. The relationship between unital and non-unital rings is explored in greater depth in \S\ref{sec:adjoint-exist}.}
