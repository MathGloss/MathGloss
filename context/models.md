Form the poset categories $P(\text{Axiom}_\sigma)$ and $P(\text{Struct}_\sigma)$ ordered by inclusion. There are contravariant functors
$ P(\text{Axiom}_\sigma)^\mathrm{op} \xrightarrow{\textup{True~in}} P(\text{Struct}_\sigma) \qquad\mathrm{and}\qquad  P(\text{Struct}_\sigma)^\mathrm{op} \xrightarrow{ \textup{Satisfying}} P(\text{Axiom}_\sigma) $ which send a set of axioms to the set of $\sigma$-structures, called **models**, that satisfy those axioms and send a set of $\sigma$-structures to the set of axioms that they satisfy.  These are mutual right adjoints, forming what is called the **Galois connection between syntax and semantics** \cite{smith-galois}.
