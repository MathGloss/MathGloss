 Russell's paradox implies that there is no set whose elements are ``all sets.'' This is the reason why we have used the vague word ``collection'' in Definition \ref{defn:category}. Indeed, in each of the examples listed in \ref{exs:concrete-categories}, the collection of objects is not a set. Eilenberg and Mac Lane address this potential area of concern as follows:

\ldots the whole concept of a category is essentially an auxiliary one; our basic concepts are essentially those of a \emph{functor} and of a natural transformation \ldots. The idea of a category is required only by the precept that every function should have a definite class as domain and a definite class as range, for the categories are provided as the domains and ranges of functors. Thus one could drop the category concept altogether and adopt an even more intuitive standpoint, in which a functor such as ``Hom'' is not defined over the category of ``all'' groups, but for each particular pair of groups which may be given. \cite{EM-general}

The set-theoretical issues that confront us while defining the notion of a category will compound as we develop category theory further. For that reason, common practice among category theorists is to work in an extension of the usual Zermelo--Fraenkel axioms of set theory, with new axioms allowing one to distinguish between ``small'' and ``large'' sets, or between sets and classes. The search for the most useful set-theoretical foundations for category theory is a  fascinating topic that unfortunately would require too long of a digression to explore.\footnote{The preprint \cite{shulman-set} gives an excellent overview, though it is perhaps better read after Chapters \ref{ch:category}--\ref{ch:adjunction}.} Instead, we  sweep these foundational issues under the rug,
 not because these issues are not serious or interesting, but because they distract from the task at hand.\footnote{If pressed, let us assume that there exists a countable sequence of **inaccessible cardinals**, meaning uncountable cardinals that are **regular**  and **strong limit**. A cardinal $\kappa$ is **regular** if every union of fewer than $\kappa$ sets each of cardinality less than $\kappa$ has cardinality less than $\kappa$, and **strong limit** if $\lambda < \kappa$ implies that $2^\lambda < \kappa$. Inaccessibility means that sets of size less than $\kappa$ are closed under power sets and $\kappa$-small unions. If $\kappa$ is inaccessible, then the $\kappa$-stage of the \emph{von Neumann hierarchy}, the set $V_\kappa$ of sets of rank less than $\kappa$, is a model of Zermelo--Fraenkel set theory with choice (ZFC); the set $V_\kappa$ is a \emph{Grothendieck universe}. The assumption that there exists a countable sequence of inaccessible cardinals means that we can ``do set theory'' inside the universe $V_{\kappa}$, and then enlarge the universe if necessary as often as needed.
