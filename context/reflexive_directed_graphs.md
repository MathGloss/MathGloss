-  $U : \textup{\textsf{Cat}} \to \textup{\textsf{DirGraph}}$ is also monadic. The monad forms (the underlying graph of) the free category on a directed graph, where identities and composites of all finite directed paths are formally added. This functor factors through a second monadic functor $, of reflexive directed graphs and homomorphisms}$U : \textup{\textsf{Cat}} \to \textup{\textsf{rDirGraph}}$, whose target is the category whose objects are **reflexive directed graphs**, with specified ``identity'' endoarrows of each vertex.



The construction of the inverse equivalence to the canonical functor $K : \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}^T$ given in the proof  of Theorem \ref{thm:monadicity} can be adapted to various other hypotheses on the given right adjoint $U : \mathsf{D} \to \mathsf{C}$. In the categorical literature, these variant theorems are traditionally assigned three-letter acronyms. Theorem \ref{thm:monadicity} is sometimes called PTT,  ``precise tripleability\footnote{``Triple'' is an antiquated synonym for ``monad.''} theorem,''  ``precise'' because the characterization involves a condition that is necessary, as well as sufficient. Statements of the ``crude tripleability theorem'' (CTT) and ``vulgar tripleability theorem'' (VTT) can be found in the exercises to \cite[\S VI.7]{maclane-categories}. Another variant is the ``reflexive tripleability theorem'':
