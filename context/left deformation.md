-  A **left deformation** on a homotopical category $\mathsf{C}$ consists of an endofunctor $Q$ together with a natural weak equivalence $q : Q \simTo 1_\mathsf{C}$.

-  A **left deformation** for a functor $F : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}$ between homotopical categories consists of a left deformation $(Q,q)$ for $\mathsf{C}$ such that $F$ preserves all weak equivalences between objects in a full subcategory containing the image of $Q$.

There is an obvious dual notion of **right deformation** $r : 1_\mathsf{C} \simTo R$.


SUGGESTION: left deformation
