[\textnormal{a categorification of the orbit-stabilizer theorem}]
Let $X : \mathsf{B} G \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ be a left $G$-set. Its **translation groupoid** $\mathsf{T}_GX$ has elements of $X$ as objects. A morphism $g : x \to y$ is an element $g \in G$ so that $g \cdot x = y$. The objects in the skeleton $\textup{\textsf{sk}}\mathsf{T}_GX$ are the connected components in the translation groupoid. These are precisely the **orbits** of the group action, which partition $X$ in precisely this manner.
