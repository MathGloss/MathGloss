 Prove that for any $F : \mathsf{C} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$, the canonical forgetful functor $\Pi : \textstyle{\int}\!{F} \to \mathsf{C}$ has the following property: for any morphism $f : c \to d$ in the ``base category'' $\mathsf{C}$ and any object $(c,x)$ in the fiber over $c$, there is a unique lift of the morphism $f$ to a morphism  in $\textstyle{\int}\!{F}$ with domain $(c,x)$ that projects along $\Pi$ to $f$. A functor with this property is called a **discrete left fibration**.


SUGGESTION: discrete left fibration
