 Prove the following strengthening of Lemma \ref{lem:iso}, demonstrating the equivalence between an isomorphism in a category and a **representable isomorphism** between the corresponding co- or contravariant represented functors: the following are equivalent:   -  $f: x \to y$ is an isomorphism in $\mathsf{C}$. -  $f_* : \mathsf{C}(-,x) \Rightarrow \mathsf{C}(-,y)$ is a natural isomorphism. -  $f^* : \mathsf{C}(y,-) \Rightarrow \mathsf{C}(x,-)$ is a natural isomorphism.



SUGGESTION: representable isomorphism
