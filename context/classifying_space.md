-  A **classifying space** for a topological group $G$ is a CW complex $BG$ that represents the functor $\textup{\textsf{Htpy}}^\mathrm{op}_{\mathrm{CW}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ that takes a CW complex to the set of isomorphism classes of \emph{principal $G$-bundles} over it.\footnote{If $G$ is a discrete group, the CW complex $BG$ is built from a collection of combinatorial data that defines the \emph{nerve} of the category $\mathsf{B} G$ (see Exercise \ref{exc:lan-adjunction-nerve}), hence our use of this notation for 1-object groupoids.}



Our language asserts that a representation encodes some sort of universal property of its representing object, but many questions remain:
