[\normalfont{the universal property of the homotopy category}]
  Any homotopical category $\mathsf{C}$  has an associated **homotopy category** $\textup{\textsf{Ho}}\mathsf{C}$ characterized by the following universal property:
the homotopy category $\textup{\textsf{Ho}}\mathsf{C}$ is initial among categories $\mathsf{E}$ equipped with a homotopical functor $\mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{E}$, that is, a functor that sends weak equivalences in $\mathsf{C}$ to isomorphisms.\footnote{Set-theoretic concerns make it somewhat tricky to specify what functor $\textup{\textsf{Ho}}\mathsf{C}$ represents. In the examples of greatest interest, $\mathsf{C}$ is not small, in which case $\textup{\textsf{Ho}}\mathsf{C}$ is a priori not even locally small, though in practice it frequently is.} In analogy with ring theory, the universal functor $\mathsf{C} \to\textup{\textsf{Ho}}\mathsf{C}$  is referred to as a **localization functor**.
