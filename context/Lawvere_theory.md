-  Show that the categories $\mathsf{N}^\mathrm{op}$ and $\mathsf{L}$ have strictly associative finite products that are preserved by the functor $I : \mathsf{N}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathsf{L}$.

When the monad $T$ is finitary, the functor $I : \mathsf{N}^\mathrm{op} \to \mathsf{L}$ defines its associated **Lawvere theory**. Because the objects in the category $\mathsf{L}$ are all iterated finite products of the object $1$, the essential data in the Lawvere theory is the set $\mathsf{L}(n,1)$ of ``$n$-ary operations.'' It is possible to recover the category of $T$-algebras, that is, the category of models for this algebraic theory, from this data \cite{linton-some}. A **model** of the Lawvere theory in $\textup{\textsf{Set}}$ is a finite product preserving functor $\mathsf{L} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$. A morphism between models is a natural transformation.
