 A category $\mathsf{J}$ is **filtered** if there is a cone under every finite\footnote{This definition can be generalized, replacing the smallest infinite cardinal $\omega$ by a regular cardinal $\kappa$: a category is $\kappa$-**filtered** if there is a cone under any diagram with fewer than $\kappa$ morphisms.} diagram in $\mathsf{J}$.
