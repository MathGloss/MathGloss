 The category of topological spaces also has two homotopical structures of interest. In the first, the class of weak equivalences is taken to be the class of homotopy equivalences. In the second, this class is enlarged to contain all **weak homotopy equivalences**, which are maps inducing isomorphisms on all homotopy groups.  The **homotopy category of spaces** is the homotopy category associated to the second homotopical structure. It is equivalent to the category $\textup{\textsf{Htpy}}_{\text{CW}}$ of CW complexes and homotopy classes of maps that appears in Examples \ref{exs:contra-rep}\eqref{itm:htpy-1} and \eqref{itm:htpy-2}.
