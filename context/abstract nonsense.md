Category theory also contributes new proof techniques, such as \emph{diagram chasing} or arguments by duality; Steenrod called these methods ``abstract nonsense.''\footnote{Lang's \emph{Algebra} \cite[p.~759]{lang-algebra} supports the general consensus that this was not intended as an epithet:
 In the forties and fifties (mostly  in the works of Cartan, Eilenberg, MacLane, and Steenrod, see \cite{Cartan-Eilenberg}), it was realized that there was a systematic way of developing certain relations of linear algebra, depending only on fairly general constructions which were mostly arrow-theoretic, and were affectionately called **abstract nonsense** by Steenrod. } The aim of this text is to introduce the language, philosophy, and basic theorems of category theory. A complementary objective is to put this theory into practice: studying functoriality in algebraic topology, naturality in group theory, and universal properties in algebra.

SUGGESTION: abstract nonsense
