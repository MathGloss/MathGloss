Category theory also contributes new proof techniques, such as \emph{diagram chasing} or arguments by duality; Steenrod called these methods ``abstract nonsense.'' The aim of this text is to introduce the language, philosophy, and basic theorems of category theory. A complementary objective is to put this theory into practice: studying functoriality in algebraic topology, naturality in group theory, and universal properties in algebra.
