By Exercise \ref{exc:hausdorff-reflective} and the dual of Proposition \ref{prop:reflective-colimit}, the presence of this adjoint implies that $\textup{\textsf{cgHaus}}$ is complete and cocomplete. The product on $\textup{\textsf{cgHaus}}$ is the $k$-ification of the product on $\textup{\textsf{Haus}}$; this latter product is preserved by the inclusion $\textup{\textsf{Haus}}\hookrightarrow\textup{\textsf{Top}}$. The pointwise right adjoint is given by the following construction of **function spaces** $\mathrm{Map}(X,Y)$: the underlying set of $\mathrm{Map}(X,Y)$ is the set of continuous maps $X \to Y$, and the topology is the $k$-ification of the compact-open topology. See \cite{steenrodconvenient} for a proof.
