-  $\textup{\textsf{Lattice}}$$, of lattices and lattice morphisms} or the categories of  meet or join semilattices\footnote{A **lattice** is a poset with all finite **meets** (limits) and **joins** (colimits), and a morphism of lattices is an order-preserving function that preserves these. A **meet semilattice** only has meets, while a **join semilattice** only has joins.}

SUGGESTION: lattice morphism
