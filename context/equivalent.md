An **equivalence of categories** consists of functors $F : \mathsf{C} \leftrightarrows \mathsf{D} : G$ together with natural isomorphisms $\eta : 1_\mathsf{C} \mathrm{co}ng GF$, $\epsilon : FG \mathrm{co}ng 1_\mathsf{D}$.\footnote{The notion of equivalence of categories was introduced by Grothendieck in the form of what we would now call an \emph{adjoint equivalence}; this definition appears in Proposition \ref{prop:adjoint-equivalence}. This explains the directions we have adopted for the natural isomorphisms $\eta$ and $\epsilon$, which are otherwise immaterial  (see Exercise \ref{exc:nat-iso-inverse}).} Categories $\mathsf{C}$ and $\mathsf{D}$ are **equivalent**, written $\mathsf{C} \simeq\mathsf{D}$, if there exists an equivalence between them.
