A diagram is typically depicted by drawing the objects and morphisms in its image, with the domain category left implicit, particularly in the case where the indexing category $\mathsf{J}$ is a preorder, so that any two paths of composable arrows have a common composite.  Nonetheless, the indexing category $\mathsf{J}$ plays an important role. Functoriality requires that any composition relations that hold in $\mathsf{J}$ must hold in the image of the diagram, which is what it means to say that  the directed graph defined by the image of the diagram in $\mathsf{C}$ is **commutative**. An immediate consequence of the form of our definition of a commutative diagram is the following result.
