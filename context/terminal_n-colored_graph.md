The Yoneda lemma is arguably the most important result in category theory, although it takes some time to explore the depths of the consequences of this simple statement. In \S\ref{sec:universal}, we define the notion of  \emph{universal element} that witnesses a universal property of some object in a locally small category. The universal element witnessing the universal property of the complete graph is an $n$-coloring of $K_n$, an element of the set $n\text{-}\textup{Color}(K_n)$. In \S\ref{sec:elements}, we use the Yoneda lemma to show that the pair comprised of an object characterized by a universal property and its universal element  defines either an initial or a terminal object in the \emph{category of elements} of the functor that it represents. This gives precise meaning to the term **universal**: it is a synonym for either ``initial'' or ``terminal,'' with context disambiguating between the two cases.  For instance, $K_n$ is the **terminal $n$-colored graph**: the terminal object in the category of $n$-colored graphs and graph homomorphisms that preserve the coloring of vertices.
