Consider $x \in X$ as a representative of its orbit $O_x$. Because the translation groupoid is equivalent to its skeleton, we must have $\mathrm{Hom}_{\textup{\textsf{sk}}\mathsf{T}_GX}(O_x,O_x)\mathrm{co}ng\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{T}_GX}(x,x) =: G_x\rlap{{\,},}$ the set of automorphisms of $x$. This group consists of precisely those $g \in G$ so that $g \cdot x = x$. In other words, the group $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{T}_GX}(x,x)$ is the **stabilizer** $G_x$ of $x$ with respect to the $G$-action. Note that this argument implies that any pair of elements in the same orbit must have isomorphic stabilizers. As is always the case for a skeletal groupoid, there are no morphisms between distinct objects. In summary, the skeleton of the translation groupoid, as a category, is the disjoint union  of the stabilizer groups, indexed by  the orbits of the action of $G$ on $X$.
