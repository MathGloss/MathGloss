-  The functor $\mathrm{mor} : \textup{\textsf{Cat}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ that takes a small category to its set of morphisms is represented by the category $\mathbbe{2}$: a functor $\mathbbe{2} \to \mathsf{C}$ is no more and no less than a choice of morphism in $\mathsf{C}$. In this sense, the category $\mathbbe{2}$ is the **free** or **walking arrow**.

SUGGESTION: walking arrow
