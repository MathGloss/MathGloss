If, in \eqref{eq:htpy-naturality}, the category $\mathbbe{2}$ were replaced by the category $\mathbbe{I}$ with two objects and a single arrow in each hom-set, necessarily an isomorphism,  then ``homotopies'' with this interval correspond bijectively to natural \emph{isomorphisms}. The category $\mathbbe{2}$ defines the **walking arrow** or **free arrow**, while $\mathbbe{I}$ defines the **walking isomorphism** or **free isomorphism**, in a sense that is explained in Examples \ref{exs:co-rep}\eqref{itm:co-rep-mor} and \eqref{itm:co-rep-iso}.

SUGGESTION: free isomorphism
