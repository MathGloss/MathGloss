It is traditional to write \mathsf{C}(X,Y)\qquad \mathrm{or}\qquad  \mathrm{Hom}(X,Y) for the set of morphisms from $X$ to $Y$ in a locally small category $\mathsf{C}$.\footnote{Mac Lane credits Emmy Noether for emphasizing the importance of homomorphisms in abstract algebra, particularly the homomorphism onto a quotient group, which plays an integral role in the statement of her first isomorphism theorem. His recollection is that the arrow notation first appeared around 1940, perhaps due to Hurewicz \cite{maclane-concepts}. The notation $\mathrm{Hom}(X,Y)$ was first used in \cite{EM-group} for the set of homomorphisms between a pair of abelian groups.} The set of arrows between a pair of fixed objects in a locally small category is typically called a **hom-set**, whether or not it is a set of ``homomorphisms'' of any particular kind. Because the notation \eqref{eq:hom-set-notation} is so convenient, it is also adopted for the collection of morphisms between a fixed pair of objects in a category that is not necessarily locally small.
