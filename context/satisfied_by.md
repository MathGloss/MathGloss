Given a set of $\sigma$-structures $M$ and a set of axioms $A$, we write $M \vDash A$ if each of the axioms in $A$ is **satisfied by**---meaning ``is true in''---each of the $\sigma$-structures in $M$. For instance, the first displayed sentence is satisfied by a structure if and only if  its interpretation of the relation ``$\leq$'' is transitive.

SUGGESTION: satisfied structure
