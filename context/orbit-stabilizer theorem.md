The set of morphisms in the translation groupoid with domain $x$ is isomorphic to $G$. This set may be expressed as a disjoint union of hom-sets $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{T}_GX}(x,y)$, where $y$ ranges over the orbit $O_x$. Each of these hom-sets is isomorphic to $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathsf{T}_GX}(x,x)=G_x$. In particular, $|G|=|O_x|\cdot|G_x|$, proving the **orbit-stabilizer theorem**.
