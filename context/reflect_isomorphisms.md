 Lemma \ref{lem:functors-pres-isos} shows that functors preserve isomorphisms. Find an example to demonstrate that functors need not **reflect isomorphisms**: that is, find a functor $F : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}$ and a morphism $f$ in $\mathsf{C}$ so that $Ff$ is an isomorphism in $\mathsf{D}$ but $f$ is not an isomorphism in $\mathsf{C}$.


SUGGESTION: reflection of isomorphisms
