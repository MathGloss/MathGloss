-  Abelian groups define a reflective subcategory $\textup{\textsf{Ab}}\hookrightarrow \textup{\textsf{Group}}$ of the category of groups. The reflector carries a group $G$ to its **abelianization**, the quotient $G/[G,G]$ by the **commutator subgroup**, the normal subgroup generated by elements $ghg^{-1}h^{-1}$. The quotient maps $G \to G/[G,G]$ define the components of the unit. For any abelian group $A$, there is an isomorphism $A \mathrm{co}ng A/[A,A]$; the commutator subgroup $[A,A]$ is trivial if and only if the group $A$ is abelian. The adjunction asserts that a homomorphism from a group $G$ to an abelian group $A$ necessarily factors through the abelianization of $G$. A similar construction defines a left adjoint to the inclusion $\textup{\textsf{CRing}}\hookrightarrow\textup{\textsf{Ring}}$ of commutative rings into the category of all rings.
