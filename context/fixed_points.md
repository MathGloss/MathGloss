An **idempotent** is an endomorphism $e : A \to A$ of some object so that $e\cdot e = e$. The limit of an idempotent in $\textup{\textsf{Set}}$ is the set of cones with summit $1$, i.e., the set of $a \in A$ so that $ea =a$. This is the set of **fixed points** for the idempotent $e$, often denoted by $A^e$.

SUGGESTION: fixed point
