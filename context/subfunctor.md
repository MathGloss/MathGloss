 A functor $F$ defines a **subfunctor** of $G$ if there is a natural transformation $\alpha : F \Rightarrow G$ whose components are monomorphisms. In the case of $G : \mathsf{C}^\mathrm{op} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$, a subfunctor is given by a collection of subsets $Fc \subset Gc$ so that each $Gf : Gc \to Gc'$ restricts to a function $Ff : Fc \to Fc'$. Characterize those subsets that assemble into a subfunctor of the representable functor $\mathsf{C}(-,c)$.
