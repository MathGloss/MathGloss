In French, a natural transformation is called a \emph{morphisme de foncteurs}.   Indeed,  for any fixed pair of categories $\mathsf{C}$ and $\mathsf{D}$, there is a **functor category** $\mathsf{D}^\mathsf{C}$ whose objects are functors $\mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}$ and whose morphisms are natural transformations. Given a functor $F : \mathsf{C} \to \mathsf{D}$, its identity natural transformation $1_F : F \Rightarrow F$ is the natural transformation whose components  $(1_F)_c :eqq 1_{Fc}$ are identities. The following lemma defines the composition of morphisms in $\mathsf{D}^\mathsf{C}$.
