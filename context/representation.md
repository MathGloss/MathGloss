$\quad$

-  A covariant or contravariant functor $F$ from a locally small category $\mathsf{C}$ to $\textup{\textsf{Set}}$ is **representable** if there is an object $c \in \mathsf{C}$ and a natural isomorphism between $F$  and the functor of appropriate variance\footnote{Some use the term ``corepresentable'' for covariant representable functors, reserving ``representable'' for the contravariant case. We argue that this distinction is unnecessary since the variance of the functor $F$ ought to be evident from its definition.} represented by $c$, in which case one says that the functor $F$ is **represented by** the object $c$.
-  A **representation** for a functor $F$ is a choice of object $c \in \mathsf{C}$ together with a specified natural isomorphism $\mathsf{C}(c,-) \mathrm{co}ng F$, if $F$ is covariant, or $\mathsf{C}(-,c)\mathrm{co}ng F$, if $F$ is contravariant.



SUGGESTION: representable functor
