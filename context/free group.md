 The left adjoint $F$ to the forgetful functor $U : \textup{\textsf{Group}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ defines the **free group** on a set $S$. Elements of the group $F(S)$ are finite ``words'' whose ``letters'' are elements $s$ of $S$ and formal ``inverses'' $s^{-1}$, modulo some evident relations. The empty word serves as the identity element and multiplication is by concatenation; the relations, in particular,  identify $ss^{-1}$ and $s^{-1}s$ with the empty word.

SUGGESTION: free group
