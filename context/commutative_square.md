 Consider $\mathbbe{2} \times \mathbbe{2}$, the category with four objects and the displayed non-identity morphisms
$ \xymatrix{ \bullet \ar[d] \ar[r] \ar[dr] & \bullet \ar[d] \\ \bullet \ar[r] & \bullet}$ In $\mathbbe{2} \times \mathbbe{2}$, the diagonal morphism is the composite of both the top and right morphisms and the left and bottom morphisms; in particular, these composites are equal. A diagram indexed by $\mathbbe{2} \times \mathbbe{2}$, typically drawn without the diagonal composite,  is a **commutative square**.
