[\normalfont{limit and colimit diagrams}]
The data of a diagram, together with a limit cone over it, is called a **limit diagram** and the data of a diagram, together with a colimit cone under it, is called a **colimit diagram**. A $\mathsf{J}$-indexed diagram and a cone over it---such as displayed in \eqref{eq:cone-over-picture}---combine to define a diagram indexed by  the category $}$\mathsf{J}^{\triangleleft}$, which has $\mathsf{J}$ as a full subcategory together with a freely-adjoined initial object. Dually, a $\mathsf{J}$-indexed diagram and a cone under it combine to define a diagram indexed by the category $}$\mathsf{J}^{\triangleright}$, which is built from the category $\mathsf{J}$ together with a freely-adjoined terminal object.  Exercise \ref{exc:cone-cat-construction} provides a more explicit construction of this category.
