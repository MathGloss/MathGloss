$\quad$
1. The isomorphisms in $\textup{\textsf{cat}}$ are precisely the **bijections**.
2. The isomorphisms in $\textup{\textsf{cat}}$, $\textup{\textsf{cat}}$, $\textup{\textsf{cat}}$, or $\textup{\textsf{cat}}_R$  are the bijective homomorphisms.
3. The isomorphisms in the category $\textup{\textsf{cat}}$ are the **homeomorphisms**, i.e., the continuous functions with continuous inverse, which is a stronger property than merely being a bijective continuous function.
4. The isomorphisms in the category $\textup{\textsf{cat}}$ are the **homotopy equivalences**.
5. In a poset $(\mathsf{P},\leq)$, the axiom of antisymmetry asserts that $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$ imply that $x=y$. That is, the only isomorphisms in the category $(\mathsf{P}, \leq)$ are identities.
