-  If $G$ is a group, regarded as a one-object groupoid, the category $(\mathsf{B} G)^\mathrm{op} \mathrm{co}ng \mathsf{B} (G^\mathrm{op})$ is again a one-object groupoid, and hence a group. The group $G^\mathrm{op}$ is called the **opposite group** and is used to define right actions as a special case of left actions; see Example \ref{ex:G-actions}.



This syntactical duality has a very important consequence for the development of category theory. Any theorem containing a universal quantification of the form ``for all categories $\mathsf{C}$'' also necessarily applies to the opposites of these categories. Interpreting the result in the dual context leads to a **dual theorem**, proven by the dual of the original proof, in which the direction of each arrow appearing in the argument is reversed. The result is a two-for-one deal: any proof in category theory simultaneously proves two theorems, the original statement and its dual.\footnote{More generally, the proof of a statement of the form ``for all categories $\mathsf{C}_1, \mathsf{C}_2, \ldots, \mathsf{C}_n$'' leads to $2^n$ dual theorems. In practice, however, not all of the dual statements will differ meaningfully from the original; see e.g.,~\S\ref{sec:para-adj}.} For example, the reader may have found Exercise \ref{exc:slice-category} redundant, precisely because the statements \eqref{itm:slice-cat-i} and \eqref{itm:slice-cat-ii} are dual; see Exercise \ref{exc:slice-cat-dual}.

To illustrate the principle of duality in category theory, let us consider the following result, which provides an important characterization of the isomorphisms in a category.

 The following are equivalent:
