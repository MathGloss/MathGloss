Many of the monadic functors that one meets in practice, such as the example $U : \textup{\textsf{Ab}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ considered above, are in fact **strictly monadic**, meaning that the canonical comparison functor defines an isomorphism of categories. Whether this comparison functor is an equivalence or an isomorphism will not make a substantial difference to the theory.

SUGGESTION: strictly monadic functor
