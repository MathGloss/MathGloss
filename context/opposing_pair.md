We use ``$\rightrightarrows$'' as an abbreviation for a **parallel pair** of morphisms, i.e., for a pair of morphisms with common source and target, and ``$\leftrightarrows$'' as an abbreviation for an **opposing pair** of morphisms with sources and targets swapped.

SUGGESTION: opposing pair of morphisms
