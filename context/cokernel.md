Before proving Corollary \ref{cor:right-exact-tensor}, we should explain its statement. The term ``right exact'' comes from homological algebra, which studies functors between  \emph{abelian categories}. An abstract definition is given in Definition \ref{defn:abelian}, but by a powerful result, Theorem \ref{thm:freyd-mitchell}, it suffices to declare that a category is **abelian** if it is a full subcategory of category of modules that contains the zero object and is closed under direct sums, kernels, and cokernels.\footnote{A **zero object** is an object that is both initial and terminal; see Exercise \ref{exc:zero-object}. Direct sums are defined in Remark \ref{rmk:direct-sum}. As in Example \ref{ex:kernel}, the **kernel** of a map $f : A \to A'$ is the equalizer of $f$ with the zero homomorphism, while the **cokernel** is the coequalizer of this pair.}

SUGGESTION: cokernel
