-  A poset $(\mathsf{P}, \leq)$ (or, more generally, a preorder\footnote{A **preorder** is a set with a binary relation $\leq$ that is reflexive and transitive. In other words, a preorder is precisely a category in which there are no parallel pairs of distinct morphisms between any fixed pair of objects. A **poset** is a preorder that is additionally antisymmetric: $x \leq y$ and $y \leq x$ implies that $x=y$.}) may be regarded as a category. The elements of $\mathsf{P}$ are the objects of the category and there exists a unique morphism $x \to y$ if and only if $x \leq y$. Transitivity of the relation ``$\leq$'' implies that the required composite morphisms exist. Reflexivity implies that identity morphisms exist.
