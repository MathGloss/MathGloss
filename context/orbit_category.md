Consider the **orbit category** _G$, of subgroups of a group $G$ represented as left $G$-sets of left cosets and $G$-equivariant maps}_G$}$\mathcal{O}_G$ associated to the group $G$. Its objects are subgroups $H \subset G$, which we identify with the left $G$-set $G/H$ of left cosets of $H$. Morphisms $G/H \to G/K$ are $G$-equivariant maps, i.e., functions that commute with the left $G$-action. By an elementary exercise left to the reader, every morphism $G/H \to G/K$ has the form $gH \mapsto g\gamma K$, where $\gamma \in G$ is an element so that $\gamma^{-1}H\gamma \subset K$.
