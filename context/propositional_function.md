 A **propositional function** is a function $P : X \to \Omega = \{ \bot, \top\}$, which we interpret as declaring, for each $x \in X$, whether $P(x)$ is true or false. The set $\Omega^X$ is then the set of propositional functions on $X$. The set $\Omega$ is given the partial order $\bot \leq \top$ from which $\Omega^X$ inherits a pointwise-defined order: $P \leq Q$ if and only if $P(x) \leq Q(x)$ for all $x \in X$, which is the case if and only if $P$ implies $Q$.

SUGGESTION: propositional function
