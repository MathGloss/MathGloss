-  The functor $\textup{Path} : \textup{\textsf{Top}} \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ that carries a topological space to its set of paths and the functor $\textup{Loop} : \textup{\textsf{Top}}_* \to \textup{\textsf{Set}}$ that carries a based space to its set of based loops are each representable by definition, by the unit interval $I$ and the based circle $S^1$, respectively. A **path** in $X$ is a continuous function $I \to X$ while a (based)  **loop** in $X$ is a based continuous function $S^1 \to X$.



The adjective ``free'' is reserved for universal properties expressed by covariant represented functors. It could be applied to any of the objects listed in Example \ref{exs:co-rep}: $\mathbbe{2}$ is the free category with an arrow, $S^1$ is the free space containing a loop. The dual term ``cofree,'' for universal properties expressed by contravariant represented functors, is less commonly used.

 The following contravariant functors are representable.


SUGGESTION: cofree space
