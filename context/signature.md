Let $\text{Axiom}_\sigma$ be a set of **axioms**, i.e., sentences in a fixed first-order language whose **signature** $\sigma$, specifies a list of function, constant, and relation symbols to be used with the standard logical symbols. Let $\text{Struct}_\sigma$ be a set of $\sigma$-**structures**, i.e., sets with interpretations of the given constant, relation, and function symbols. For instance, the language of the natural numbers has a constant symbol ``0,'' a binary function symbol ``+,'' and a binary relation symbol ``$\leq$.'' A structure for this language is any set with a specified constant, binary function, and binary relation. Axioms include sentences such as
$ \forall x , y , z,  ((x \leq y) \wedge (y \leq z)) \to (x \leq z) \qquad  \mathrm{or} \qquad \forall x, x+ 0 = x\rlap{{,},}$ asserting transitivity of the relation ``$\leq$'' and that the constant ``$0$'' serves as a unit for the binary function ``$+$.''
