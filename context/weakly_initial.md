 $\quad$ 
 -  An object $c$ in a category $\mathsf{C}$ is **weakly initial** if for every $x \in \mathsf{C}$ there exists a morphism $c \to x$ (but possibly more than one).
 -  A collection of objects $\Phi = \{c_i\}$ in a category $\mathsf{C}$ is **jointly weakly initial** if for every $x \in \mathsf{C}$ there exists some $c_i \in \Phi$ for which there exists a morphism $c_i \to x$.
  
 

SUGGESTION: weakly initial object
