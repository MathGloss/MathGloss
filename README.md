# Welcome to MathGloss
MathGloss is a project to create a knowledge graph for undergraduate mathematics automatically, using modern NLP tools. These include concept and entity recognition, entity and definition extraction, parsing, and other natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

A preprint describing this prototype is available at [MathGloss: Building mathematical glossaries from text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12649).
