An (geometric) **$n$-simplex** is the smallest [[convex set]] in $\mathbb R^m$ containing $n+1$ points $v_0,\dots, v_n$ that do not lie in a [[hyperplane]] of [[dimension of vector space|dimension]] less than $n$. That is, that are [[geometrically independent]].

The **standard $n$-simplex** is the set $$\Delta^n = \{(t_0,\dots, t_n)\in\mathbb R^{n+1} \mid \sum_i t_i =1 \text{ and } t_i \geq 0 \forall i\}.$$

The order of the vertices $v_i$ is part of the data of an $n$-simplex. Writing an $n$-simplex as $[v_0,\dots, v_n]$ determines orientation of the edges $[v_i, v_j]$ by their order.
