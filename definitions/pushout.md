A **pushout** is a [[colimit|colimit]] of a $\cdot \leftarrow \cdot \to \cdot$ [[D-shaped diagram|shaped diagram]]. That is, in a given [[category]] $\mathcal C$, the **pushout** of the morphisms $f:Z\to X$ and $g:Z\to Y$ in $\mathcal C$  consists of an object $P$ of $\mathcal C$ and two morphisms $i_1:X\to P$ and $i_2:Y\to P$ such that the diagram ![[Screen Shot 2022-02-17 at 3.51.35 PM.png]]
[[commutative diagram|commutes]] and such that $(P, i_1,i_2)$ is [[universal property|universal]] with respect to the diagram.  Again, that is, for any other triple $(Q, j_1,j_2)$ in $\mathcal C$ such that the following [[commutative diagram|diagram commutes]], there exists a unique $u:P\to Q$ so that the diagram commutes. ![[Screen Shot 2022-02-17 at 3.56.27 PM.png]]
