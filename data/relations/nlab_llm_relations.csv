Specifically, if $X$ is the unit type it is interpreted as a terminal object of $\mathcal{C}$, and then the function $f$ is identified simply with a term $y_0 \coloneqq f(*) $. In this case the substitution is _evaluation_ of the proposition at $y_0$, the resulting monomorphism $$ \array{ P(y_0) &\longrightarrow&",deepseek-v3.1:671b-cloud,,no,"{""label"": ""none"", ""type_main"": ""unknown"", ""type_linked"": ""class"", ""evidence_spans"": [], ""confidence"": 0.5}"
