https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/neo4j-supported-versions/

+ Python 3.13 supported.
+ Python 3.12 supported.
+ Python 3.11 supported.
+ Python 3.10 supported.


Installation
============

To install the latest stable version, use:

.. code:: bash

    pip install neo4j


.. TODO: 7.0 - remove this note

.. note::

    ``neo4j-driver`` is the old name for this package. It is now deprecated and
    and will receive no further updates starting with 6.0.0. Make sure to
    install ``neo4j`` as shown above.


Alternative Installation for Better Performance
-----------------------------------------------

You may want to have a look at the available Rust extensions for this driver
for better performance. The Rust extensions are not installed by default. For
more information, see `neo4j-rust-ext`_.

.. _neo4j-rust-ext: https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j-python-driver-rust-ext


Quick Example
=============

.. code-block:: python

    from neo4j import GraphDatabase, RoutingControl


    URI = "neo4j://localhost:7687"
    AUTH = ("neo4j", "password")


    def add_friend(driver, name, friend_name):
        driver.execute_query(
            "MERGE (a:Person {name: $name}) "
            "MERGE (friend:Person {name: $friend_name}) "
            "MERGE (a)-[:KNOWS]->(friend)",
            name=name, friend_name=friend_name, database_="neo4j",
        )


    def print_friends(driver, name):
        records, _, _ = driver.execute_query(
            "MATCH (a:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(friend) WHERE a.name = $name "
            "RETURN friend.name ORDER BY friend.name",
            name=name, database_="neo4j", routing_=RoutingControl.READ,
        )
        for record in records:
            print(record["friend.name"])


    with GraphDatabase.driver(URI, auth=AUTH) as driver:
        add_friend(driver, "Arthur", "Guinevere")
        add_friend(driver, "Arthur", "Lancelot")
        add_friend(driver, "Arthur", "Merlin")
        print_friends(driver, "Arthur")
