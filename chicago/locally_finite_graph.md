A [graph](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/graph) $X$ is **locally finite** if each vertex is a [boundary](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/boundary) point of only finitely many eges or if $X$ is a [locally compact](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/locally_compact) [topological space](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/topological_space).
