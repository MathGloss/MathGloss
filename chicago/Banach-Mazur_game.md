A **Banach-Mazur game** $MB(X,Y, \mathcal W)$ is a [topological game](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/topological_game) played as follows:

Let $X$ be a [topological space](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/topological_space), $Y$ a fixed subset of $X$, and $\mathcal W$ a family of subsets of $X$ such that
1. each element of $\mathcal W$ has nonempty [interior](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/interior).
2. every nonempty subset of $X$ contains an element of $\mathcal W$. 

Players 1 and 2 take turns picking elements of $\mathcal W$ in a sequence $W_1\supset W_2\supset\cdots$. Player 1 wins if and only if $$
Y\cap \left(\bigcap_{n<\omega} W_n\right)$$ is nonempty. If Player 1 loses, Player 2 wins.
