The **discriminant** of a collection $\{x_i\}_{i=1}^n$ of elements of a [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field) (or a [ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring)?) to be $$D = \prod_{i<j} (x_i-x_j)^2.$$ The **discriminant of a polynomial** is the discriminant of the roots of the polynomial.
