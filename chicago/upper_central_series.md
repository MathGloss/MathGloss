Let $G$ be a [group](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/group). The **upper central series** for $G$ is an ascending sequence of [subgroups](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/subgroup) of $G$ defined as follows: Let $Z_0(G) = \{e\}$ and let $Z_1(G)$ be the [center](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/center_of_a_group) $Z(G)$. Then for each $i\geq 1$, define $Z_{i+1}(G)$ to be a [subgroup](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/subgroup) of $G$ containing $Z_i(G)$ such that the [quotient by normal quotient](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/quotient_by_normal_#########quotient) $Z_{i+1}(G)/Z_i(G) = Z(G/Z_i(G))$.  Note that because the [center is a normal subgroup](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/center_is_a_normal_subgroup), these [quotient by normal quotients](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/quotient_by_normal_#########quotients) are well-defined. Also note that this series may or may not reach $G$.
