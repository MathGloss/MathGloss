Let $V = \bigoplus_{i\geq0} V_i$ be a [graded vector space](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/graded_vector_space). A **graded subspace** is a [vector subspace](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/vector_subspace) of $V$ of the form $W = \bigoplus_{i\geq 0}W_i$ for $W_i \subseteq V_i$.  Clearly, this is only the case when $W= \bigoplus_{i\geq 0} (W\cap V_i)$.
