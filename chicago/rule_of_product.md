If there are $a$ ways of doing one thing and $b$ ways of doing another thing, then there are $ab$ ways of doing both things.  This can be extended [inductively](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/induction).

Set theoretically, this is the definition of the product of [cardinal numbers](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/cardinal_numbers): $${\vert}S_1{\vert}\cdot{\vert}S_2{\vert}\cdots{\vert}S_n{\vert} = {\vert}S_1\times S_2\times\cdots S_n{\vert}$$ where ${\vert}\cdot{\vert}$ is the [cardinal number](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/cardinal_number) of the sets $S_i$ and $\times$ is the [Cartesian product](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/Cartesian_product) of sets. The sets need not be finite nor does the number of sets.
