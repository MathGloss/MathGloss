The **Lebesgue measure** on $\mathbb R^n$ is constructed as follows: 

A set $A \subset\mathbb R^n$ is **Lebesgue measurable** if for every $S\subset \mathbb R^n$, we have the following relation in the [Lebesgue outer measure](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/Lebesgue_outer_measure) $\lambda^*$: $$\lambda^*(S) = \lambda^*(S\cap A) + \lambda^*(S\setminus A).$$ 

By [Carathéodory's extension theorem](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/Carathéodory's_extension_theorem), Lebesgue measurable sets $A$ form a [σ-algebra](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/σ-algebra) and the Lebesgue measure of any such set coincides with its [Lebesgue outer measure](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/Lebesgue_outer_measure).
