An **algebraic number** is a number that is a root of a nonzero [polynomial](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/polynomial_ring) in one variable over $\mathbb Q$. It is often denoted by $\overline{\mathbb Q}$. The algebraic numbers form a field, but *not* a subfield (nor even a subset) of $\mathbb Q$.
