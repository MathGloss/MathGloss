 title: action of a group on quotient by subgroup

Let $G$ be a [group](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/group) with [subgroup](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/subgroup) $H$ and let $G/H$ be the [quotient](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/quotient_by_subgroup) of $G$ by $H$. Then $G$ [acts](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/group_action) on $H$ in a natural way: for all $Z = aH \in G/H$, $g\cdot Z = gZ = (ga)H$.
