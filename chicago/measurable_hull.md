Let $(X,\Sigma, \mu)$ be a [measure space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measure_space) and let $A \subset X$. The **measurable hull** $H$ of $A$ is the [measurable](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measurable) set $H\supseteq A$ such that for any [measurable](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/measurable) set $F$ satisfying $A\subseteq F\subseteq H$, we have $\mu(F) = \mu(H)$.
