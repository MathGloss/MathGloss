A **field** is a set $F$ together with two [binary operations](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/binary_operation) addition ($+$) and multiplication ($\cdot$) such that
- Addition and multiplication are both [associative](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/associative);
- Addition and multiplication are both [commutative](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/commutative);
- There exist two distinct elements $0\neq 1$ in $F$ such that $0$ is an additive [identity](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/identity_element) and $1$ is a multiplicative [identity](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/#################identity);
- Every element of $F$ has an additive [inverse](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/inverse_element);
- Every nonzero element of $F$ has a multiplicative [inverse](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/################inverse);
- Multiplication distributes over addition as follows: $a\cdot (b+c) = (a\cdot b) + (a\cdot c)$ for all $a,b,c\in F$. 

Equivalently, a **field** is a [commutative](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/commutative) [division ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/division_ring).
