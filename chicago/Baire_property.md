A subset $A$ of a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) $X$ has the **Baire property** if there exists an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) set $G$ such that the [symmetric difference](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/symmetric_difference) of $A$ and $G$ ($A \triangle G$) is [meager](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/meager).
