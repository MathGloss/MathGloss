Let $A$ be a [graded algebra](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/graded_algebra). A **graded ideal** of $A$ is an [left algebra ideal](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/left_algebra_ideal) that is also a [graded vector subspace](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/graded_vector_subspace). It is also called a **homogeneous ideal** of $A$.
