A **norm** $N$ on a [ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring) $R$ is a function $N: R\to \mathbb N$ (here $\mathbb N$ is assumed to include $0$) such that $N(0) = 0$. Such a function is called **positive** if it is nonzero on every element except for the additive [identity](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/identity_element).
