Let $X$ be a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space) and let $C_n(X)$ be the [free group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/free_group) [abelian](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/abelian) [group](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/group) on the set of [singular n-simplices](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/singular_n-simplex) in $X$. Elements of $C_n(X)$ are called **singular $n$-chains** and are written as finite formal sums $$\sum_i n_i\sigma_i$$ for $n_i\in\mathbb Z$ and $\sigma_i:\Delta^n\to X$.
