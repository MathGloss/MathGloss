A set $X$ is **countable** if there exists a [bijection](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/bijective) between $X$ and the set $\mathbb N$ of natural numbers. 

$\vert \mathbb N\vert = \aleph_0$ is the [cardinal number](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/cardinal_number) of the naturals.
