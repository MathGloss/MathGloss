Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [topological space](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space). The **opposite topology** on  $X$ has open sets given by the sets that are [closed](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/closed) under the original [topology](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/topological_space).
