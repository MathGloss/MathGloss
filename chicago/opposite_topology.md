Let $(X,\tau)$ be a [topological space](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/topological_space). The **opposite topology** on  $X$ has open sets given by the sets that are [closed](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/closed) under the original [topology](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/topological_space).
