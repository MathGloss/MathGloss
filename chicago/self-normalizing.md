Let $L$ be a [Lie algebra](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/Lie_algebra) with [subalgebra](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/subalgebra) $K$. If $K$ is equal to its own [normalizer of a vector space](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/normalizer_of_a_vector_space) (i.e. $K = N_L(K)$), then $K$ is called **self-normalizing**.
