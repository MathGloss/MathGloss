Let $\mathbb Q_p$ be the [field](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/field) of [p-adic numbers](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/p-adic_field) under the $p$-adic [absolute value](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/absolute_value). Define
$$\mathcal P = \{x\in\mathbb Q_p\mid |x|_p< 1\}.$$ We call this **curly $\mathcal P$** because it has no other name that I have been able to find. It is a subset of the [p-adic integers](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/p-adic_integers), and in particular it is an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) ball in the $p$-adic [absolute value topology](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/absolute_value_induces_a_topology) which means that [it is also](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/every_non-Archimedean_ball_is_clopen) [closed](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/closed).

We can also define the "powers" of $\mathcal P$ by $$\mathcal P^n = \{x\in\mathbb Q_p\mid |x_p|<p^{-k}\}.$$
