An **ideal** $I$ of an [algebra](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/algebra_over_a_field) $A$ is a subset $I\subset A$ that is both a [left algebra ideal](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/left_algebra_ideal) and a [right algebra ideal](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/right_algebra_ideal). In the case that $A$ is a [commutative](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/commutative) [algebra](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/#####################algebra), these notions coincide and every right ideal is also a left ideal is also a two-sided ideal.

As long as the [ring](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring) $R$ is not a [rng](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/rng), $A$ will inherit the definition of [ideal](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/ring_ideal) from its [underlying ring structure](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/algebras_are_rings).
