If we have $a$ ways of doing one thing and $b$ ways of doing another thing but we cannot do both at the same time, then there are $a+b$ ways to choose to do one thing.

Set theoretically, the sum of the sizes of a finite collection of pairwise disjoint sets is the [size](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/cardinal_number) of the union of the sets. That is,
$$\vert S_1\vert  + \vert S_2\vert  + \cdots + \vert S_n\vert  = \vert S_1\cup S_2\cup\cdots\cup S_n\vert .$$
