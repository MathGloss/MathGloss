If we have $a$ ways of doing one thing and $b$ ways of doing another thing but we cannot do both at the same time, then there are $a+b$ ways to choose to do one thing.

Set theoretically, the sum of the sizes of a finite collection of pairwise disjoint sets is the [size](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/cardinal_number) of the union of the sets. That is,
$$|S_1| + |S_2| + \cdots + |S_n| = |S_1\cup S_2\cup\cdots\cup S_n|.$$
