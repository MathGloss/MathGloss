Let $\mathcal A$ be a collection of [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) sets in $\mathbb R^n$ and let $A$ be their union. A **partition of unity subordinate to $\mathcal A$** is a countable collection of [smooth](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/smooth) functions $\{\phi_i\}_{i\in I}$ such that $\phi_i:\mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R$ such that 
1. each $\phi_i \geq 0$.
2. each $\phi_i$ has [compact support](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/compact_support) contained in some $U \in \mathcal A$.
3. for all points $a$ of $A$, there exists an [open](https://defsmath.github.io/DefsMath/open) neighborhood $V$ of $a$ such that all but finitely many of the $\phi_i$ are zero on $V$.
4. for all points $a$ in $A$, $\sum\limits_{i\in I} \phi_i(a) = 1$.
