An **algebraic integer** is a number that is the root of a [monic](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/monic) [polynomial](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/polynomial_ring) over $\mathbb Z$. The algebraic integers form a ring. Note that it is *not* a subring (nor even a subset) of $\mathbb Z$.
