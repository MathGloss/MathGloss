 title: differentiability in closed half-space

Let $U\subset\mathbb H^n$ be [open](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/open) in the [subspace topology](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/subspace_topology) on $H^n$ considered as a subset of $\mathbb R^n$. Then a function $f:U\to\mathbb R^m$ is **differentiable** if there is an open set $V \subset\mathbb R^n$ such that $U = V\cap H^n$ onto which we may extend $f$ to a [differentiable](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/differentiable) function $f_V:V\to\mathbb R^n$.
