Let $A$ be a [graded algebra](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/graded_algebra). A **graded subalgebra** of $A$ is a [subalgebra](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/subalgebra) of $A$ that is also a [graded vector subspace](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/graded_vector_subspace) of $A$ as a [graded vector space](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/chicago/graded_vector_space).
