A **partition** of a set $X$ is a subset $\mathcal S$ of the [power set](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/power_set) $\mathcal P(X)$ such that 
1. $A\in \mathcal S$ implies that $A\neq \emptyset$;
2. For every $x\in X$, there is a unique $A\in \mathcal S$ such that $x\in A$. (Equivalently, the union of the sets $A\in \mathcal S$ is $X$ and the intersection of any two elements of $\mathcal S$ is empty.)
