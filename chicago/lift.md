Let $X$ and $Y$ be [topological spaces](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/topological_space). A **lift** of a [continuous](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/continuous) map $f:Y\to X$ is a map $\tilde f:Y\to \tilde X$ such that $p\tilde f = f$ where $p$ is the map associated to the [covering space](https://mathgloss.github.io/MathGloss/covering_space) $(p,\tilde X)$.
